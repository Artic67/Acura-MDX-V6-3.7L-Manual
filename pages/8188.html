When substantial weight is removed from the rear of the vehicle, the center of gravity can change causing the vehicle to tip forward on the lift.<br><br><b>Vehicle Lift</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/404241554.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Position the hoist lift blocks (A) under the vehicle's front support points (B) and rear support points (C).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Raise the lift a few inches, and rock the vehicle gently to be sure it is firmly supported.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Raise the lift to its full height, and inspect the vehicle support points for solid contact with the lift blocks.<br><br><b>Safety Stands</b><br>To support the vehicle on safety stands, use the same support points (B and C)as for a vehicle lift.
