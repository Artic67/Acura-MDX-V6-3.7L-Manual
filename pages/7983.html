There is a diagnosis worksheet included to take on your test-drive and record your findings. These values are used to build the 15-digit DTC (diagnostic trouble code) that is required for your warranty claim. The last step in each repair procedure helps you create the correct code.<br><br>In the rare case that you have to repair a vehicle that pulls and has the steering wheel off-center, use REPAIR PROCEDURE B to file your warranty claim.<br><br>PROBABLE CAUSES<br><br>Several conditions can cause the vehicle to pull or drift:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Wheel alignment<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span><a href="2108.html">Tires</a><br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Steering wheel off-center (no pulling or drifting, but a client may believe this is the case)<br><br>CORRECTIVE ACTION<br><br>Diagnose the problem using the special tools and the worksheet on page 4 that guides you to one of three repair procedures.<br><br>TOOL INFORMATION<br><br>Centering Tape (enough <br>to diagnose 240 vehicles):<span class='indent-32'>&#09;</span>T/N 07AAJ-001A300<br><br>Steering Drift Set Level:<span class='indent-32'>&#09;</span>T/N 07AAJ-001A200<br><br>Steering Drift Set:<span class='indent-32'>&#09;</span>T/N 07AAJ-001A140<br><br>Replacement Weight<br>for Steering Drift Set:<span class='indent-32'>&#09;</span>TIN 07AAJ-001A400<br><br>WARRANTY CLAIM INFORMATION<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/371933860.png"></div><br><br><br><br>In warranty: <br>The normal warranty applies.<br><br>Failed Part:<span class='indent-19'>&#09;</span>P/N 53560-SDA-A01<br><br>Defect Code:<span class='indent-19'>&#09;</span>07406<br><br>Symptom Code:<span class='indent-19'>&#09;</span>03602<br><br>Skill Level:<span class='indent-19'>&#09;</span>Repair Technician<br><br>Diagnostic<span class='indent-19'>&#09;</span>To create the 15-digit DTC, see<br><br>Trouble Code:<span class='indent-19'>&#09;</span>the applicable repair procedure.<br><br>Out of warranty: <br>Any repair performed after warranty expiration may be eligible for goodwill consideration by the District Parts and Service Manager or your Zone Office.

It is a bracket that counts as one weight, plus five removable weights.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/371999475.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>During the test-drive, attach the bracket and the weights to the steering wheel on the side opposite the pulling direction. For example, if the vehicle pulls to the right, attach the bracket and weights to the left side of the steering wheel. Start with the maximum amount of weight on the steering wheel, and remove the weights until the vehicle drives in a straight line.<br><br>When recording the pull on the worksheet, write down the direction of the pull (left or right) and the number of weights required to balance the pull (one through six). For example, you have the bracket and two weights on the steering wheel. Record this as three weights.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/372127546.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Road Crown Gauge<br><br>The road crown gauge measures the amount of road crown. Almost all roads have a crown to help drain water during rainstorms. Use the suction cup to attach the road crown gauge to the vehicle in a vertical position. If necessary, bend the bracket until the gauge is vertical. Once you attach and align the road crown gauge, calibrate the gauge to zero. There are two ways to calibrate the gauge:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Park the vehicle on a level surface, like an alignment rack, and calibrate the gauge by moving the gauge until the ball is on the zero mark.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If you do not have a perfectly flat surface, park the vehicle on a reasonably flat surface and note the gauge reading. Turn the vehicle 1800 and, with the <a href="2108.html">tires</a> in the same spot, note the new gauge reading. Then move the gauge half of the difference. Example: Your first reading is +3 and after moving the vehicle, the gauge reads -1. The difference is 4 degrees. Position the gauge to read +1.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/372197245.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><b>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>You must calibrate the gauge with the same weight in the vehicle that you will use for the test-drive. If you plan to have an assistant help you during the test-drive, calibrate the gauge while both of you are sitting in the vehicle.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/372294049.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Steering Wheel Offset Gauge<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/372373867.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>The steering wheel offset gauge is a sticker that attaches to the steering wheel and the steering column cover. Place the sticker on the steering wheel when the steering wheel is straight. When you test-drive the vehicle, you can read how many millimeters the steering wheel is off-center.<br><br>NOTE:<br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle is pulling, repairing the pull may correct the steering wheel offset.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/372472838.png"></div><br><br><br><br>DIAGNOSIS WORKSHEET<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/68613041.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
