<h1>Cruise Control: Description and Operation</h1><b><a href="0.html#Cruise%20Control/">Cruise Control</a></b><br><br><b>How the Circuit Works</b><br><br>The vehicle does not use a throttle cable or cruise control actuator to maintain the vehicle speed during the <a href="0.html#Cruise%20Control/">cruise control</a> mode. A throttle actuator motor, located on the side of the throttle housing, opens and closes the throttle plate for routine driving and cruise conditions.<br><br><b>Power Supply</b><br><br>Fuse 10 (in the under-hood fuse/relay box) supplies battery voltage at all times to the ETCS control relay switch contact in the under-hood fuse/relay box. The PGM-FI main relay 1 supplies battery voltage to the ETCS control relay coil. The PCM grounds the coils of both the ETCS control relay and PGM-FI main relay 1, activating both relays. Activating the ETCS control relay provides battery voltage to the PCM which controls the throttle actuator.<br><br>Fuse 7 (in the under-dash fuse/relay box) supplies battery voltage at all times to the control block, which is located in the under-hood fuse/relay box.<br><br>Fuse 11 (hot at all times) (in the main under-hood fuse box), and fuse 18 (hot in on or start) (in the under-dash fuse relay box) supply battery voltage to the brake pedal position switch.<br><br><b>System Description</b><br><br>With the shift lever in D or D3, the transmission range switch provides a ground to the PCM, and the <a href="0.html#Cruise%20Control/">cruise control</a> system can be set. It is necessary to accelerate the vehicle to speeds above <b>25 mph</b> to set the cruise control system.<br><br>Pressing the cruise main switch grounds a reference voltage at the gauge control module through G501, and the cruise main indicator illuminates.<br><br>Pressing the set switch sends a reference voltage signal to the gauge control module activating the cruise system.<br><br>The gauge control module communicates the set signal via multiplex communication lines (F-CAN) to the PCM. Using the vehicle speed input from the TP sensor, the PCM opens and closes the throttle plate maintaining the set vehicle speed.<br><br>Pressing the brake pedal supplies a battery voltage input to the PCM through fuse 11 (in the main under-hood fuse box) and removes battery voltage through fuse 18 (in the under-dash fuse relay box) from the PCM.<br><br>Pressing the brake pedal deactivates the <a href="0.html#Cruise%20Control/">cruise control</a> system. The PCM communicates the brake pedal pressed information via multiplex communication (F-CAN) lines to the gauge control module.<br><br>Pressing the resume switch supplies a reference voltage signal to the gauge control module reactivating the <a href="0.html#Cruise%20Control/">cruise control</a> system to the previously set speed.<br><br>Pressing the cancel switch supplies two reference voltage signals to the gauge control module deactivating the cruise system.</div>
