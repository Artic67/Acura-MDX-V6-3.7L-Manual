<h1>How to Install Pigtail Terminals</h1><b>HOW TO INSTALL PIGTAIL TERMINALS</b><br><br>Pigtail terminals (short pieces of wire with a factory crimped terminal) are used when the wire is too short or when access to the connector is too restricted to make a terminal repair.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  To replace just a connector terminal, go to How to Replace Connector Terminals.<br><br><b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION:<br><br>On some models, the SRS wires are in a separate harness. If the SRS harness is damaged, replace the harness; do not repair it. On other models, wire harnesses include yellow SRS wires. If any SRS wire is damaged, replace the entire harness; do not repair it.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the damaged or faulty terminal from the connector. Use the proper removal tool from Pin Tool Set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cut off the wire about an inch back from where it connects to the damaged or faulty terminal, then strip about half of the insulation off that piece. This will be used to size the wire end of the replacement pigtail terminal.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  If you are not sure of the wire size, start with a large enough hole on the stripper that will not nick or cut off any strands of wires.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/119550084.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select a pigtail terminal that matches the original wire at both ends (same kind of terminal and same diameter bare wire).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select the smallest splice connector (yellow, pink, or blue) that will fit onto the stripped end of the original wire.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Insert the pigtail terminal into the connector cavity; push it in until it locks in place.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/119554872.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lay the pigtail and the original wire side-by-side, and cut off both ends at once. If you are making more than one splice, do not cut each pigtail at the same location; the resulting "lump" of splice connectors would interfere with rewrapping the harness. Instead, cut the first pigtail close enough to the terminal so you will have room to make each remaining cut about <b>20 mm (3/4 inch)</b> farther down on the next pigtail.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If you are using a yellow splice connector, strip about <b>6 mm (1/4 inch)</b> of insulation off the ends of both wires. If you are using a pink or blue splice connector, strip off about <b>8 mm (5/16 inch)</b> of insulation.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  If you nick or cut off any strands of wire, try again with the next larger size hole on the stripper.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/119557445.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Put the splice connector in the proper size slot in the Crimper Tool, slide it to one end (where the flare begins), and close the crimper handles far enough to hold it in place. To release the ratchet mechanism at any point after the first click, squeeze the handles slightly and push the release lever, then let the handles open.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/119558565.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Insert one of the bare wires into the splice connector end that is in the crimper jaws. Push the wire all the way into the splice connector, and squeeze the crimper handles. Keep squeezing until the jaws touch, and hold it at that position until the ratchet clicks again.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/119562375.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Crimp the other wire in the same way into the other end of the splice connector.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>11.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After crimping, gently pull on the wires in the opposite directions to make sure they are secure in the connector.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>12.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Separate the other wires in the harness from the repaired wire(s), and shield them with nonflammable material.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/119563542.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>13.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Plug in the heat gun, and turn it on. Start at the middle of the splice connector, and move the gun toward the ends as the tube shrinks. Apply heat evenly by rotating the curved heat spreader around the splice connector. Shrinking is complete when a small amount of sealant appears at each end of the tube.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  Be careful when working with the high heat produced by the heat gun.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/119566167.png"></div><br><br><br></div>
