<h1>Electronic Control System</h1><b>Electronic Control System</b><br><br>The functions of the fuel and <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Emission%20Control%20Systems/">emission control systems</a> are managed by the powertrain control module (PCM).<br><br><b>Self-diagnosis</b><br>The PCM detects a signal failure from a sensor or from another <a href="1434.html">control unit</a> and stores a Temporary DTC or a DTC in erasable memory (RAM). Depending on the failure, a DTC is stored in either the first or the second drive cycle (for DTC P0457, the DTC is set in the beginning of the third drive cycle). When a DTC is stored, the PCM turns on the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) by sending a command to the gauge control module.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>One Drive Cycle Detection Method</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When an abnormality occurs in the signal from a sensor or from another <a href="1434.html">control unit</a>, the PCM stores a DTC for the failure and turns on the <a href="668.html">MIL</a> immediately.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Two Drive Cycle Detection Method</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When an abnormality occurs in the signal from a sensor or from another <a href="1434.html">control unit</a> in the first drive cycle, the PCM stores a Temporary DTC for the failure. The <a href="668.html">MIL</a> does not come on at this time. If the failure continues in the second drive cycle, the PCM stores a DTC in erasable memory and turns on the MIL.<br><br><b>Fail-safe Function</b><br>When an abnormality occurs in the signal from a sensor or from another <a href="1434.html">control unit</a>, the PCM ignores that signal and substitutes a pre-programmed value that allows the engine to continue running. This causes a DTC to be stored and the <a href="668.html">MIL</a> to come on.<br><br><b><a href="668.html">MIL</a> Bulb Check and Readiness Code Condition</b><br>When the <a href="1643.html">ignition switch</a> is turned ON (II), the PCM turn on the MIL by sending a command to the gauge control module to check the bulb condition. If any readiness codes are not set to complete, the MIL flashes five times. If all readiness codes are set to complete, the MIL goes off.<br><br><b>Self Shut Down (SSD) Mode</b><br>After the <a href="1643.html">ignition switch</a> is turned OFF, the PCM stays on (<b>up to 15 minutes</b>). If the PCM connector is disconnected during this time, the PCM may be damaged. To cancel this mode, disconnect the negative cable from the battery or jump the SCS line with the HDS after the ignition switch is turned OFF.</div>
