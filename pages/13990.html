<h1>Adding and Deleting Keys or Keyless Transmitters</h1>Vehicles originally come with three programmed ignition keys. The immobilizer-keyless control unit accepts a total of six transponder codes, so three more codes can be stored in its memory. Use the following procedures to add a key, to add multiple keys, to replace programmed keys, or to clear the codes of lost keys.<br><br>Adding a Key<br><br>Use the HDS (Honda Diagnostic System) with Acura key blanks to add a key. Make sure you use only key blanks with a V stamped on the shank. The HDS rewrites the immobilizer-keyless control unit, storing the transponder code of the new key in the memory of the control unit.<br><br>Preparation<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Refer to the parts catalog for the correct P/Ns, and search by the VIN for the correct parts.<br><br>To add a key with the HDS, you need these items:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Immobilizer Master Key Blank<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>or<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Immobilizer Valet Key Blank<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>One programmed ignition key (master or valet) for the vehicle<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Key code for the vehicle (if cutting by code)<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Suitable key cutting machine<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>PCM code<br><br><b><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>If you cannot log in to the iN screen on the HDS, you must retrieve the PCM code from the Immobilizer Code Inquiry in the iN.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>HDS with the latest software<br><br><b><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Make sure the market, the date, and the time on the HDS setup screen are correct.
