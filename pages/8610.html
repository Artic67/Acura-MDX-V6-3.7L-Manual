<h1>Circuit Schematics</h1><b>Circuit Schematics</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/117796476.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br>Each schematic represents one circuit. A circuit's wires and components are arranged to show current flow, from power at the top of the diagram, to ground at the bottom.<br><br><b>Shared Circuits</b><br>Other circuits may share power or ground terminals or wiring with the circuit shown. A wire that connects one circuit to another, for example, is cut short and has an arrowhead at the end of it pointing in the direction of current flow. Next to the arrowhead is the name of the circuit or component which shares that wiring. To quickly check shared wiring, check the operation of a component it serves. If that component works, you know the shared wiring is OK.<br><br><b>Connectors</b><br>All in-line and junction connectors are numbered (C725, C416, etc.). Component connectors are not numbered but are identified either by the name of the component if the component only has one connector, or by a capital letter (A, B, C, etc.) if the component has more than one connector.<br><br>Below most connector numbers and component names are PHOTO and VIEW numbers. The PHOTO number refers to a photo at Vehicle Level Locations that shows the connector's location on the car. The VIEW number refers to an connector view at the Vehicle Level Connector Views that shows the connector terminals, wire colors, connector cavity numbers, and other details.<br><br>The connector cavity numbering sequence begins at the top left corner of the connector as seen from either of the viewpoints. Except for the DLC (data link connector), disregard any numbers molded into the connector housing.<br><br><b>Wires</b><br>Wires are identified by the abbreviated names of their colors; the second color is the color of the stripe. Wires are also identified by their location in a connector. The number "2" next to the male and female wire terminals at C554, for example, means those terminals join in cavity 2 of connector C554.</div>
