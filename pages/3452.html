<h1>Seats: Description and Operation</h1><b>Power Seats</b><br><br><b>How the Circuit Works</b><br><br><b>Power Supply</b><br><br>Fuses 13 and 17 (in the under-dash fuse/relay box) supply battery voltage at all times to the front passenger's power seat adjustment switch.<br><br><b>Slide</b><br><br>Moving the slide switch FORWARD supplies battery voltage through fuse 17 to the slide motor. The slide motor grounds through the BACKWARD contact of the slide switch. The motor runs until the switch is released or the seat reaches the full forward position.<br><br>Moving the slide switch BACKWARD supplies battery voltage through fuse 17 to the slide motor. The slide motor grounds through the FORWARD contact of the slide switch. The motor runs until the switch is released or the seat reaches the full backward position.<br><br>The front up/down switch and the rear up/down switch work identically to the slide switch.<br><br><b>Recline</b><br><br>Moving the recline switch FORWARD supplies battery voltage through fuse 13 to the recline motor. The recline motor grounds through the BACKWARD contact of the recline switch. The motor runs until the switch is released or the seat reaches the full forward position.<br><br>Moving the recline switch to BACKWARD supplies battery voltage through fuse 13 to the recline motor. The recline motor grounds through the FORWARD contact of the recline switch. The motor runs until the switch is released or the seat reaches the full backward position.<br><br><b>Lumbar Support System<br><br>Power Supply</b><br><br>Fuse 2 (in the under-dash fuse/relay box) supplies battery voltage at all times to the driver's lumbar support switch.<br><br><b>Raise Lumbar Support</b><br><br>Moving the lumbar support switch FORWARD supplies battery voltage to the lumbar support motor.
