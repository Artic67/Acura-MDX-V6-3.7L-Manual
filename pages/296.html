<h1>Routine Service</h1><b>Owner Safety Checks</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Promptly take any safety problems to your dealer for service advice.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Parking brake park on a fairly steep hill and hold the vehicle with the parking brake only. This checks its holding ability.<br><br><b>Starter safety switch </b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check the safety switch by trying to start the engine in each gear. The starter should work only with the shift lever in the "P" (Park) or "N" (Neutral) position.<br><br><b>Transmission shift indicator </b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check that the indicator points to the gear chosen.<br><br><b>Steering </b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Be alert for any changes in steering action. An inspection or service is needed when the steering wheel is harder to turn or has too much free play, or if there are unusual sounds when turning or parking.<br><br><b>Wheel alignment, balance and <a href="2108.html">tires</a> </b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Uneven or abnormal tire wear, or pulling to the right or left on a straight and level road may show the need for a wheel alignment. A vibration of the steering wheel or seat at normal highway speeds means wheel balancing is needed. Check tire pressures (including the spare) at least monthly and whenever the vehicle is serviced.<br><br><b>Brakes </b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Watch for the "BRAKE" light coming on. Other signs of possible brake trouble are such things as repeated pulling to one side when braking, unusual sounds when braking or between brake applications, or increased brake pedal travel. If you note one of these conditions, have the system checked at once and repaired if needed.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Sit in the driver's seat and perform these checks;<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>With the engine stopped, depress the brake pedal several times; the travel distance and effective pedal stroke should remain unchanged.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Start the engine with the brake pedal fully depressed.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The brake pedal should go down a little as the engine starts.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Depress the brake pedal, stop the engine and hold the pedal depressed for about 30 seconds: the brake pedal should remain in position without rising or going down.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Restart the engine and run it for about a minute, then turn it off and depress the brake pedal firmly several times; the brake pedal travel should decrease each time the brake pedal is depressed.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the brakes do not operate normally, have them checked and corrected by your dealer.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Exhaust system Be alert to any changes in the sound of the exhaust system or any smell of fumes. These are signs the system may be leaking or overheating. Have the system checked and/or repaired at once, if these conditions exist.<br><br><b>Windshield wipers and washers</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check operation and condition of the wiper blades. Check the flow and aim of the washer spray.<br><br><b>Defrosters</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check performance by moving the controls to the defrost setting and noting the amount of air directed against the windshield.<br><br><b>Rear view mirrors and sunvisors</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check that the friction joints hold the mirrors and sunvisors firmly in place.<br><br><b>Horn</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Blow the horn now and then to be sure it works.<br><br><b>Lap and shoulder belts</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check the belt system, including webbing, buckles, latch plates, retractors, guide loops and anchors for proper operation and damage.<br><br><b>Seat-back latches</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Seat-back latches are designed to prevent forward motion of the seat-back when the vehicle stops suddenly. Check to see that the seat-back latches are holding by pulling forward on the top of the folding seat-back.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Also check to see that the reclining seats are operating properly.<br><br><b>Lights and beepers</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check panel lighting, warning lights, and the seat belt reminder light and beeper. Also check the key beeper and interior lights. On the outside, check the license plate light, side marker lights, headlights, parking lights, taillights, brake lights, turn signals, backup lights and hazard warning flashers. Have the headlight aim checked promptly if the beams seem to be aimed improperly.<br><br><b>Glass </b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check for broken, scratched or damaged glass that could reduce visibility or cause injury.<br><br><b>Door latches </b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check that the doors close, latch and lock securely.<br><br><b>Hood latch </b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check that the hood closes firmly. Check for broken, damaged, or missing parts that might prevent secure latching. Make sure the secondary latch keeps the hood from opening all the way when first released.<br><br><b>Fluid leaks </b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check for fuel, water, oil or other fluid leaks by looking at the surface beneath the vehicle after it has been parked for awhile. Water dripping from the air conditioning system after use is normal. If you notice gasoline fumes or fluid at any time, locate the source and have it corrected at once.<br><br><b>Spare tire and jack</b>  <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check that the spare tire and all jack gear are securely stowed at all times.<br><br><b>Tailgate door latches </b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check that the tailgate doors close, latch and lock securely.<br><br><b>Underbody</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Corrosive materials used for road-ice, snow removal and dust control can collect on the underbody. If these materials are not removed, accelerated corrosion (rust) can occur on underbody parts such as the fuel line, frame, floor pan and exhaust system. At least once a year, in the spring, flush these materials from the underbody with plain water.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Take care to thoroughly clean any areas where mud and other debris can collect. Sediment trapped in closed areas of the frame should be loosened before being flushed.<br><br><b>Air Bag</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Supplemental Restraint System <b>(SRS)</b> should be inspected every ten years.<br><br></div>
