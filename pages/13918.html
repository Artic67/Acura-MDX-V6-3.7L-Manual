The moonroof can also be opened with the remote transmitter (see <a href="1644.html">Key</a> and Remote Transmitter Operation in this bulletin).<br><br>Check / Refresh the XM Satellite Radio Dealer Demo Service<br><br>The XM Satellite Radio comes from the factory activated with the dealer demo service. Once you install the No.4 fuse, the XM radio will receive the full range of available XM channels. Make sure this service is activated by checking if the radio is getting channels 000, 001, 007, 009, 047, 122, 174, and 247. If it is not, do a rapid refresh on the iN (Interactive Network). Without the dealer demo service activated, the XM radio only displays channels 000, 001,174, and 247. To check if the dealer demo service is activated, do this:<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the <a href="1643.html">ignition switch</a> to ON (II). Turn on the radio, and enter the audio unit anti-theft code. Then press the XM button.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the radio is in CHANNEL MODE, not CATEGORY MODE.

Tune to channel 001 and leave the radio ON (II) for 7 minutes to refresh the dealer demo service. No further action is needed.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If you can only tune to channels 000, 001, 174, and 247, the dealer demo service is not yet activated, and an activation refresh needs to be done. Go to step 5.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the TUNE knob to 000, then write down the 8-digit XM radio ID number you see in the audio unit display. You need this number, your dealer number, and the VIN to do an activation refresh of the dealer demo service. Then go to step 6.<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>If you cannot tune to channel 000, you are in CATEGORY MODE.

This brings up the DEALER ACTIVATION REFRESH screen.<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If you cannot bring up this display, call the iN Support Center.<br><br>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Enter the 8-digit XM Satellite Radio ID number you wrote down in step 5. Then click on Submit. You will see the ACTIVATION REFRESH screen once the ID number is recognized.<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If you entered the ID number incorrectly, or it was not recognized, you will see an error display. If this happens, follow the instructions on the display.<br><br>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the TUNE knob to 001 to make sure you are receiving the XM signal.

No further action is needed.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If you can only tune to channels 000, 001, 174, and 247, the dealer demo service is not yet activated. Repeat steps 9 and 10 for up to 2 hours until the dealer demo service is activated.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If, after 2 hours, you can only tune to channels 000,001,174, and 247, repeat steps 6 thru 10.<br><br><b>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>The dealer demo service lasts for 7 months or until the vehicle's RDR (retail delivery registration) is submitted.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>After the vehicle is registered, the dealer demo service converts to a client account. The client gets a 3-month trial service of all available non-premium XM channels. If the client decides to end the service after that time, the XM radio reverts to preview mode. Normal AM and FM radio reception is not affected by ending the service.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>The XM radio receives digital programming broadcasts from two fixed-orbit satellites near the equator along with a network of ground antennas (repeaters). You will get the strongest signal if you park the vehicle where there is a clear view of the southern sky.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>The XM radio may lose reception when you are driving through a tunnel, under an overpass, inside a parking garage, or near the northern face of a canyon or a mountain.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>To cut down on reception loss, the XM radio uses a buffer. If the reception loss lasts longer than the buffering period, the signal goes silent.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Because the XM radio signal is digital, any reception loss makes the signal go silent; the signal usually does not fade like it does with a conventional radio.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>If you ever need to replace the XM <a>radio receiver</a>, call XM Satellite Radio at (800) 852-9696. Be prepared to give them your dealer number, the VIN, and the XM radio ID numbers from the printed label on the side of the old and the new receiver units.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Your client's XM radio presets will be lost if you disconnect the 12-volt <a href="1599.html">battery</a> or if it goes dead.
