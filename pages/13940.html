The kit is used to add small amounts of dye to A/C systems to help locate smaller leaks that an electronic leak detector might not find.<br><br>When searching for leaks, always begin by using an electronic leak detector. Refer to Service Bulletin 97-013, Denso HLD-100 Halogen Leak Detector, for tips on using this tool, then follow up with the OPTIMAX Jr.<br><br>This new detection kit complements, but does not replace the electronic detector.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/397981357.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>The kit contains:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>TRP8640CS, OPTIMAX Jr. (TM) cordless, fluorescent leak detection flashlight lamp (includes 3 standard AA batteries)<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>TRP38600601, (6) 0.06 oz.

Additional kits and replacement capsules may be ordered through the Acura Tool and Equipment Program. On the IN, click on Service, Service Bay, Tool and Equipment Program, Online Catalog tab, and Air Conditioning Equipment.*<br><br><b>NOTICE</b><br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Only Tracer-Stick single-dose fluorescent dye capsules from Tracer Products (Tracerline(R) are approved for use in Acura vehicles. Other dyes contain solvents that may contaminate the system's <a href="210.html">refrigerant oil</a>, leading to component failure.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Adding excessive amounts of dye can lead to compressor damage and failure.<br><br>USING THE OPTIMAX JR.<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Before adding any leak-detection dye, check to see if there is dye in the system now.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Check for a label in the engine compartment indicating that fluorescent leak-detection dye has been added to the system.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Dye may have been added even though no label is present. To confirm this:<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>-116GPut on the fluorescence-enhancing glasses, and remove the low-side service port sealing cap.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Direct the ultraviolet lamp into the valve stem area. If dye has been previously added, the lubricant traces will have a bright yellow fluorescent glow. You may need to press the port's valve stem briefly to release some lubricant and dye from the system.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If there is no dye in the system, go to step 2.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If there is dye in the system, go to step 5.

If the air and moisture have been evacuated, go to step 3; otherwise do the following:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(a)<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Attach the empty dye capsule (provided in the dye kit) to the control valve fitting.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(b)<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Attach the service valve fitting (provided in the kit) to the empty dye capsule.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(c)<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Attach the low-side hose of the A/C recovery and charging station, and open the quick coupler's hand-wheel valve. Then open the control valve (black knob) on the universal connect set.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(d)<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Following the manufacturer's instructions for your recovery and charging station, evacuate the universal connect set for approximately 3 minutes.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(e)<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>When evacuation is complete, be sure the set's control valve is closed (finger tight), and disconnect the NC recovery and charging station.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(f)<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Remove the service valve fitting and the empty dye capsule from the set, and store them for future use.<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Check the <a href="209.html">refrigerant</a> charge level.

Open the blue hand-wheel valves on both quick couplers. Leave the control valve (black knob) on the universal connect set closed.<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><br>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>If you have recovered <a href="209.html">refrigerant</a> to weigh it as part of your diagnostics, or if there is a low charge, it is more efficient to recharge the system using normal procedures before installing the universal connect set. Dye can then be added using approximately 0.05 lb (0.02 kg) of refrigerant.*<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>You do not need to connect the service equipment's high-side hose to the vehicle to install the dye. If the high-side hose is connected, make sure its coupler valve is closed before proceeding.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Do not use the A/C recovery and charging station to recover or evacuate the A/C system when a full dye capsule is attached. The dye will be drawn into the service equipment instead of being added to the vehicle's A/C system.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the A/C system for leaks:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(a)<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Run the A/C system for at least 15 minutes to circulate the dye through the system. Large leaks will be seen immediately as a fluorescent yellow glow. Smaller leaks may require at least 24 hours of vehicle operation before they become visible. Operate the A/C system as much as possible during this time to keep the dye circulating.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(b)<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Stop the vehicle's engine, and inspect the system for leaks using the ultraviolet (UV) lamp and fluorescence-enhancing glasses from the kit. Low ambient light conditions (a dark work area) will aid in locating the leak.<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Not all UV lamps work well with all types of fluorescent dye. Use only the lamp provided in the kit to inspect for leaks.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>(c)<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Inspect the entire system.
