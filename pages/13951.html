Since the system interfaces with other systems in the vehicle, it is important to ensure that all of the systems are initialized so they will work properly for the client. To initialize the system, follow this procedure:<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do the normal TQI of the vehicle, including the audio system. The <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> voice will not function until you enter the 5-digit anti-theft code for the audio system.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the XM(R) Satellite Radio dealer demo account has been set up by tuning to XM stations 000, 001, 007, 009, 047, 122, 174, and 247. If these stations can be received, the demo account is fully active.<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>For 2007-09 MDXs, XM Satellite Radio and real-time traffic are free for the first 3 months. After 3 months, clients must subscribe to XM radio and/or real-time traffic to continue receiving coverage by calling 800-852-9696, or going online to www.xmradio.com. They will need their XM radio ID (displayed when you tune to channel 0) and a credit card.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the MID (multi-information display) shows Welcome DRIVER 1 or Welcome DRIVER 2 when you first get into the vehicle and turn the ignition switch to ON (II).<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the MID shows only Welcome when you turn the ignition to ON (II), the remotes are not linked with the vehicle and any changes made to the setup settings will not be saved.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>You must link the remotes before proceeding.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Refer to the Body Electrical section of the 07-09 MDX Service Manual or, online, enter keywords KEYLESS DESC, and select Keyless/Power Door Locks/Security System Description from the list.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/797024577.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>You could possibly see the factory In Line Diagnosis screen below. If you see the screen, do this:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Press and hold the MENU, MAP/GUIDE, and CANCEL buttons at the same time until the Select diagnosis menu screen comes up.

Next, enter the 4-digit security code for the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a>. The code is on the Navigation Anti-Theft Code card.<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>If the anti-theft code card is lost, you can find the code on the iN (Interactive Network) by using the anti-theft code option and the serial number. To get the serial number, go to the Navi ECU Diagnostic screen (see the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> diagnostic mode in the service manual), or look on the underside of the navigation unit under the driver's seat.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>If you cannot find the code on the iN, contact American Honda's Warranty Department.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>If the anti-theft code does not work, try entering 0000 (four zeros) as the code.

The system is still initializing but will not automatically exit when the initialization is complete. Do not immediately follow the instructions on the screen. After 30 minutes, try restarting the vehicle to see if the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> completed the initialization. If it did not, follow the instructions on the screen.<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The initialization screen may appear after battery voltage to the navigation control unit has been disconnected for more than 5 minutes.

Information about the road's average speed, turn restrictions, or whether it is a one-way street are contained in the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a>. Roads within metropolitan areas (detailed coverage), interstate freeways, and major roads connecting cities are typically verified. They can be recognized on the screen (daytime setting) as the darker colored roads.<br><br>Unverified roads may be found in rural areas. Because information about these roads may have inaccuracies, they are shown for reference only. They are seen on the screen (daytime setting) as a light brown color.<br><br>Guidance in unverified areas depends on the setting for unverified routing made during setup. If the setting is OFF, you will see a dotted blue vector line pointing to your destination when driving in an unverified area. You will have to manually choose roads from the map to get to your destination. If the setting is ON, then you will see a blue/pink route line and receive route guidance.
