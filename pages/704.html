<h1>Fuel Supply System</h1><b>Fuel Supply System</b><br><br><b>Fuel Cutoff Control</b><br>During deceleration with the throttle valve closed, current to the injectors is cut off to improve fuel economy at engine speeds <b>over 850 rpm</b>. Fuel cutoff control also occurs when the engine speed <b>exceeds 6,600 rpm</b>, regardless of the position of the throttle valve, to protect the engine from over-revving. When the vehicle is stopped, the PCM cuts the fuel at engine speeds <b>over 5,000 rpm</b>. Engine speed of fuel cut is lower on a cold engine.<br><br><b><a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">Fuel Pump</a> Control</b><br>When the <a href="1643.html">ignition switch</a> is turned on, the PCM grounds PGM-FI main relay 2 which feeds current to the fuel pump control module. The PCM sends a signal to the fuel pump control module to operate the fuel pump for <b>2 seconds</b> to pressurize the fuel system. With the engine running, the fuel pump speed is controlled in four levels by the fuel pump control module. The PCM decides the fuel pump speed by the calculation of the injector activation time and engine speed and sends a operation command signal to the fuel pump control module. This operation made possible to decrease fuel pump noise at low engine speed.<br><br><b>PGM-FI Main Relay land 2</b><br>PGM-FI main relay 1 is energized whenever the <a href="1643.html">ignition switch</a> is ON (II) to supply battery voltage to the PCM, power to the injectors, and power for PGM-FI main relay 2. PGM-FI main relay 2 is energized to supply power to the <a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">fuel pump</a> for <b>2 seconds</b> when the ignition switch is turned ON (II), and when the engine is cranking or running.</div>
