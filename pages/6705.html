<h1>Advanced Diagnostics</h1><b>DTC P0735: Problem in 5th Clutch and 5th Clutch Hydraulic Circuit (5th gear incorrect ratio)</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/30415700.png"></div><br><br><br><b>General Description</b><br>To engage 5th gear, line pressure is supplied to the 5th clutch piston, engaging the 5th clutch, and the input shaft (mainshaft) and the input shaft (mainshaft) 5th gear are connected and revolve together. Hydraulic pressure is supplied to the 5th clutch through the ATF strainer -> the ATF pump -> the regulator valve -> the manual valve -> the shift valves -> the feed pipe -> 5th clutch piston. (A shift valve failure in the supply route above is detected by the malfunction detection of each shift solenoid valve.) The powertrain control module (PCM) computes the ratio of the input shaft (mainshaft) speed to the output shaft (countershaft) speed. When the ratio is not the 5th gear ratio, it is detected as a malfunction of the hydraulic circuit or the 5th clutch, and a DTC is stored.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/30419892.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Monitor Execution, Sequence, Duration, DTC Type, OBD Status</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/30422434.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Enable Conditions</b><br><br><b>Malfunction Threshold</b><br>The actual gear ratio must match one of these conditions for <b>at least 12 seconds</b> with the 5th gear command.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Actual gear ratio is greater than the 5th gear ratio by a factor of 1.2.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Actual gear ratio is less than the 5th gear ratio by a factor of 0.75.<br><br><b>Driving Pattern</b><br>Start the engine, shift to the D position, and drive the vehicle at a <b>speed of 8 mph (12 km/h) or more</b> for <b>at least 12 seconds</b> in 5th gear.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle in this manner only if the traffic regulations and ambient conditions allow.<br><br><b>Diagnosis Details</b><br><br><b>Conditions for illuminating the MIL</b><br>When a malfunction is detected during the first drive cycle, a Temporary DTC is stored in the PCM memory. If the malfunction recurs during the next (second) drive cycle, the DTC and the freeze frame data are stored. The MIL does not come on.<br><br><b>Conditions for clearing the MIL</b><br>The DTC, the Temporary DTC, and the freeze frame data can be cleared by using the scan tool Clear command or by disconnecting the battery.</div>
