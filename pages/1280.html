<h1>Differential Assembly: Description and Operation</h1><b>System Description</b><br><br><b>SH-AWD System</b><br><br><b>Outline</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>This vehicle is equipped with a Super Handling All-wheel Drive (SH-AWD) rear differential system. This system uses electromagnetic clutches and the SH-AWD <a href="1434.html">control unit</a> to control front to rear torque distribution and independent left to right rear torque distribution. This allows the system to function as a limited slip differential and as a torque distribution system to improve standing start performance, straight-line stability, climbing, and cornering ability.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>SH-AWD features include<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Independent torque distribution to the front and rear wheels, and to the left and right wheels for neutral handling when cornering.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Controls differential (inside/outside) wheel speed in a turn to increase cornering stability.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Limited slip differential function for better acceleration.<br><br><b>Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When driving in a straight line, the front and rear wheels are traveling at the same speed. In a normal turn, the distance traveled by the front wheels is longer than that of the rear wheels. The SH-AWD system monitors the speed of the front wheels, and increases torque to the outside rear wheel proportionally. This improves stability and steering response, and on slippery surfaces it provides improved traction of the 4-wheel drive system.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/580518003.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Construction</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="0.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Differential%20Assembly/">differential assembly</a> has a conventional hypoid ring and pinion gear set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The direct electromagnetic clutch system consists of the coils, the planetary gear sets, and the multi-plate clutches that are installed in the side cases on either side of the differential carrier. When driving straight ahead, both rear wheels rotate at the same speed. When turning, current is applied to the appropriate outside wheel main coil to engage the clutch. The amount of current passed through the electromagnetic clutch controls the amount of driving force to the outside wheel.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/580522692.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>SH-AWD 4WD Control System</b><br><br><b>Control System</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The SH-AWD control system consists of a SH-AWD <a href="1434.html">control unit</a>, the PCM, the VSA modulator-control unit, along with various sensors and switches that detect the steering angle, the lateral G force, the yaw, and the vehicle speed. A fluid temperature sensor is located on in the rear differential. The control units exchange information via the F-CAN communication lines. The SH-AWD control unit has a self-diagnostic function. If a malfunction is detected, the SH-AWD control unit turns on the SH-AWD indicator in the gauge assembly and the system goes into fail-safe mode. When in fail-safe mode, the vehicle disables the SH-AWD differential. The vehicle defaults to front wheel drive, reduces engine torque to suit the driving conditions.<br><br><b>Driving Force Control</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The driving force control distributes the power based on the driver's inputs. It distributes torque to the front and rear wheels based on the throttle opening and the available engine torque output. When turning, torque is applied to the rear wheels independently based on the lateral G input and the direction of the turn. This generates an inward yaw movement to help steer the vehicle around the turn.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/580533854.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Electromagnetic Clutch System</b><br><br><b>Construction</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The electromagnetic clutch system is incorporated into the side case assemblies on both sides of the differential case. The system consists of the multi-plate clutches, the planetary gears, the pressure guides, the solenoid coil assembly (the search coil and the main coil) the armature assembly (the slider and the armature) and the yoke.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/580557771.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The SH-AWD <a href="1434.html">control unit</a> receives inputs from the PCM and the VSA modulator-control unit on the driving conditions via the F-CAN. The SH-AWD control unit sends signals to the main coils, which engage the electromagnetic clutches that connect the planetary gear set. This increases the torque applied to the rear wheels. The amount of current sent to the clutch is continuously varied as driving conditions change.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/580574036.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Search Coil Detection System</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>As the <a>clutch discs</a> wear, the air gap between the pressure guides and the multi-plate clutches increases. The increase in air gap changes the magnetic field generated by the main coil and the yoke. The search coil detects these changes in the magnetic field. The SH-AWD <a href="1434.html">control unit</a> uses predetermined maps to compensate for the changes to maintain precise control and smooth clutch engagement.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/580593402.png"></div><br><br><br><h3>SH-AWD Control Unit Electrical Connections:</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/580600258.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>SH-AWD <a href="1434.html">Control Unit</a> Inputs and Outputs</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The SH-AWD control unit terminal voltages and the measuring conditions for the SH-AWD control system.
