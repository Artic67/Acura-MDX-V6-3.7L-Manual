Enter the 4-digit anti-theft security code, then select "Done".<br><br>If the code cannot be found, use the Interactive Network (;'N) to look it up. You can view the serial number in the Navi ECU diagnostic screen. Also, you can find the serial number on the navigation unit that is stored under the driver's seat. The serial number is on a label on the bottom of the unit.<br><br>When replacing the navigation unit, be sure to give the client's the new anti-theft security code.<br><br><b>Symptom Diagnosis</b><br>Certain circumstances and system limitations will result in occasional vehicle positioning errors. Some client's may think this indicates a problem with the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> when, in fact, the system is normal. Keep the following items in mind when interviewing client's about symptoms of the navigation system.<br><br><b>Self-Inertial Navigation Limitations</b><br>The limitations of the self-inertial portion of the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> (the yaw rate sensor and the vehicle speed signal) can cause some discrepancies between the vehicle's actual position and the indicated vehicle position (GPS vehicle position).<br><br>The following circumstances may cause vehicle positioning errors:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Moving the vehicle with the engine stopped and the vehicle stopped, such as by ferry or tow truck, or if the vehicle is spun on a turn table.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tire slippage, changes in tire rolling diameters, and some driving situations may cause discrepancies in travel distances.

Review the navigation manual and compare it to a known-good vehicle (with the same software and database), under the same conditions. If the symptom is not the same as the known-good vehicle, follow the self-diagnostic procedures and the appropriate troubleshooting procedures.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the symptom does not reappear or only reappears intermittently, ask the client about the conditions when the symptom occurred.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Always ask the client to demonstrate the problem.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Try to establish possible user error or misunderstanding of the system.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Try to establish if outside interference may have been the cause.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Try to duplicate the symptom under the same conditions the client experienced.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Vibration, temperature extremes, and moisture (dew, humidity) are factors that are difficult to duplicate.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Inspect the vehicle for after-market electronic devices (vehicle locators, amps, radar detectors, etc) that may be hidden.<br><br><b>Service Precautions</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the navigation unit needs to be replaced, you can back-up the navigation data and transfer it to a new navigation unit.

Audio remembers presets even if the battery is disconnected. Also obtain any PGM-FI or transmission DTCs and freeze frame data (which will be lost when the PCM loses power).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the battery is disconnected, the internal GPS clock is reset to "0:00". The clock will reset to the correct time after the system finishes GPS initialization.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After reconnecting the battery, you have to wait to get the initial signal from the satellite.

If it does, the given screen appears:<br><br>If this procedure is not necessary, the system proceeds directly to the Disclaimer screen. During initialization, the system searches for all available GPS satellites, and obtains their orbital information. During this procedure, park the vehicle out in the open with a clear view of the sky.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/782735275.png"></div><br><br><br>If the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> finds the satellites properly, this box clears, and changes to the Disclaimer screen.

If you now seethe Disclaimer screen, the GPS initialization is complete.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The average acquiring time is <b>less than 10 minutes</b>, but it can take <b>as long as 45 minutes</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the system is still unable to acquire a signal, follow the instructions on the screen. If this screen appears again, go to troubleshooting for the GPS icon is white or not shown.<br><br><b>Map Matching</b><br>This part of the initialization matches the GPS coordinates with a road on the map screen. To perform this part of the procedure, ensure that the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> is displaying a map. Check the "GPS" icon in the upper left corner of the screen, it should be "Green" when the vehicle is parked outside, with the correct color labeled DVD installed in the navigation unit. Drive the vehicle on a mapped road shown on the map screen. Do not enter a destination at this time. When the name of the current road you are driving on, appears at the bottom of the screen, the entire procedure is complete. Your system is now ready to use.<br><br><b>Obtaining A Navigation DVD</b><br>If the navigation DVD is lost or damaged, or you need a yearly updated DVD, you have two ways to purchase one. You can either call (888) 549-3798, or order on-line at www.acura.com "ORDER NAVIGATION DVD" link.<br><br>Both methods require a credit card.
