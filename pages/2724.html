You can view the serial number in the Navi ECU diagnostic screen. Also, you can find the serial number on the navigation unit that is stored under the driver's seat. The serial number is on a label on the bottom of the unit.<br><br>When replacing the navigation unit, be sure to give the client's the new anti-theft security code.<br><br><b>Symptom Diagnosis</b><br>Certain circumstances and system limitations will result in occasional vehicle positioning errors. Some client's may think this indicates a problem with the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> when, in fact, the system is normal. Keep the following items in mind when interviewing client's about symptoms of the navigation system.<br><br><b>Self-Inertial Navigation Limitations</b><br>The limitations of the self-inertial portion of the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> (the yaw rate sensor and the vehicle speed signal) can cause some discrepancies between the vehicle's actual position and the indicated vehicle position (GPS vehicle position).<br><br>The following circumstances may cause vehicle positioning errors:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Moving the vehicle with the engine stopped and the vehicle stopped, such as by ferry or tow truck, or if the vehicle is spun on a turn table.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tire slippage, changes in tire rolling diameters, and some driving situations may cause discrepancies in travel distances.

Audio remembers presets even if the battery is disconnected. Also obtain any PGM-FI or transmission DTCs and freeze frame data (which will be lost when the PCM loses power).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the battery is disconnected, the internal GPS clock is reset to "0:00". The clock will reset to the correct time after the system finishes GPS initialization.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After reconnecting the battery, you have to wait to get the initial signal from the satellite.

If it does, the given screen appears:<br><br>If this procedure is not necessary, the system proceeds directly to the Disclaimer screen. During initialization, the system searches for all available GPS satellites, and obtains their orbital information. During this procedure, park the vehicle out in the open with a clear view of the sky.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/782735275.png"></div><br><br><br>If the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> finds the satellites properly, this box clears, and changes to the Disclaimer screen.

To perform this part of the procedure, ensure that the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> is displaying a map. Check the "GPS" icon in the upper left corner of the screen, it should be "Green" when the vehicle is parked outside, with the correct color labeled DVD installed in the navigation unit. Drive the vehicle on a mapped road shown on the map screen. Do not enter a destination at this time. When the name of the current road you are driving on, appears at the bottom of the screen, the entire procedure is complete. Your system is now ready to use.<br><br><b>Obtaining A Navigation DVD</b><br>If the navigation DVD is lost or damaged, or you need a yearly updated DVD, you have two ways to purchase one.
