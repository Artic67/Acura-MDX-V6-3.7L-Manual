If the vehicle is still within the warranty period, the Acura District Parts and Service Manager must give approval and/or special instruction before deploying the part(s). Only after the part(s) have been deployed (as the result of vehicle collision, for example), can they be scrapped.<br><br>If the parts appear intact (not deployed), treat them with extreme caution.
