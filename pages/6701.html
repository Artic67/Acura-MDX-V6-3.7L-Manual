<h1>Advanced Diagnostics</h1><b>DTC P0733: Problem in 3rd Clutch and 3rd Clutch Hydraulic Circuit (3rd gear incorrect ratio)</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/30200979.png"></div><br><br><br><b>General Description</b><br>To engage 3rd gear, line pressure is supplied to the 3rd clutch piston, the 3rd clutch is engaged, and the output shaft (countershaft) and the output shaft (countershaft) 3rd gear are connected and revolve together. Hydraulic pressure is supplied to the 3rd clutch through the ATF strainer -> the ATF pump -> the regulator valve -> the manual valve -> the shift valves -> the feed pipe -> 3rd clutch piston. (The shift valve failure in the supply route above is detected by the malfunction detection of each shift solenoid valve.) The powertrain control module (PCM) computes the ratio of the input shaft (mainshaft) speed to the output shaft (countershaft) speed. When the ratio is not the 3rd gear ratio, it is detected as a malfunction of the hydraulic circuit or the 3rd clutch, and a DTC is stored.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/30205244.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Monitor Execution, Sequence, Duration, DTC Type, OBD Status</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/30207791.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Enable Conditions</b><br><br><b>Malfunction Threshold</b><br>The actual gear ratio must match one of these conditions for <b>at least 12 seconds</b> with the 3rd gear command.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Actual gear ratio is greater than the 3rd gear ratio by a factor of 1.2.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Actual gear ratio is less than the 3rd gear ratio by a factor of 0.75.<br><br><b>Driving Pattern</b><br>Start the engine, shift to the D position, and drive the vehicle at a <b>speed of 8 mph (12 km/h) or more</b> for <b>at least 12 seconds</b> in 3rd gear.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle in this manner only if the traffic regulations and ambient conditions allow.<br><br><b>Diagnosis Details</b><br><br><b>Conditions for illuminating the MIL</b><br>When a malfunction is detected during the first drive cycle, a Temporary DTC is stored in the PCM memory. If the malfunction recurs during the next (second) drive cycle, the DTC and the freeze frame data are stored. The MIL does not come on.<br><br><b>Conditions for clearing the MIL</b><br>The DTC, the Temporary DTC, and the freeze frame data can be cleared by using the scan tool Clear command or by disconnecting the battery.</div>
