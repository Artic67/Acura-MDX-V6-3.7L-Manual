<h1>Advanced Diagnostics</h1><b>DTC P0872: Short in 4th Clutch Transmission Fluid Pressure Switch Circuit, or 4th Clutch Transmission Fluid Pressure Switch Stuck ON</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/33655380.png"></div><br><br><br><b>General Description</b><br>The 4th clutch transmission fluid pressure switch is installed in the hydraulic pressure circuit to the 4th clutch. When hydraulic pressure is supplied to the 4th clutch, the switch is turned ON. When hydraulic pressure is not supplied to the 4th clutch, the switch is turned OFF. The signal from the 4th clutch transmission fluid pressure switch is input to the powertrain control module (PCM). The PCM detects the hydraulic pressure supply conditions at the gear change to 4th gear (3rd -> 4th, 5th -> 4th) to reduce the shock that occurs at the gear change.<br><br>If the 4th clutch transmission fluid pressure switch is ON while driving, and the speed ratio of the output shaft (countershaft) to input shaft (mainshaft) is other than 4th gear (the ratio is Neutral or 5th), the PCM detects a 4th clutch transmission fluid pressure switch failure and stores DTC.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/33659867.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Monitor Execution, Sequence, Duration, DTC Type, OBD Status</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/33662411.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Enable Conditions</b><br><br><b>Malfunction Threshold</b><br>The input signal from the 4th clutch transmission fluid pressure switch to the PCM is low when driving in 5th gear.<br><br><b>Driving Pattern</b><br>Start the engine, and drive the vehicle in the D position and 5th gear for <b>at least 2 seconds.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle in this manner only if the traffic regulations and ambient conditions allow.<br><br><b>Diagnosis Details</b><br><br><b>Conditions for illuminating the indicator</b><br>When a malfunction is detected, the D indicator blinks, and the DTC and the freeze frame data are stored in the PCM memory.
