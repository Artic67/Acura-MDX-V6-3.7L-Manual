<h1>Paint - Environmental Fallout Damage</h1>99-033<br><br>January 26, 2007<br><br>Applies To: <br>ALL<br><br><a href="3331.html">Paint</a> Damage From Environmental Fallout<br><br>(Supersedes 99-033, dated August 9, 1999, to update the information marked by the black bar and asterisks<br><br>SYMPTOM<br><br>The exterior <a href="3331.html">paint</a> surface does not feel smooth after the vehicle is washed.<br><br>PROBABLE CAUSE<br><br>Environmental fallout (airborne metallic particles, tree sap, <a href="3331.html">paint</a> overspray, road tar, insect residue, etc.) has adhered to the exterior paint surface.<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>This form of <a href="3331.html">paint</a> damage should not be confused with acid rain damage. Unlike environmental fallout damage, acid rain damage appears on the paint surface as pits or water spots-possibly black or brown in the center-which may feel smooth to the touch.<br><br>PREVENTION<br><br>The shipping wax/wrap guard applied to the vehicle at the factory provides the best protection for the <a href="3331.html">paint</a> finish from environmental fallout and acid rain damage. American Honda strongly recommends that you leave the shipping wax/wrap guard on the vehicle for as long as possible. Your dealership is responsible for maintaining the vehicle's finish after the shipping wax/ wrap guard is removed.<br><br>CORRECTIVE ACTION<br><br>Select a product line from one of the manufacturers listed in REQUIRED MATERIALS to clean the <a href="3331.html">paint</a> surface and to wax it after cleaning. Make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions for each of the products you use.<br><br>REQUIRED MATERIALS<br><br>Each of the clays listed should do at least three vehicles.<br><br>WARRANTY CLAIM INFORMATION<br><br>In warranty: <br>American Honda will reimburse for this repair only under these conditions:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>It is done during TQI<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>No more than 30 days have elapsed since the vehicle was received at the dealership (according to the date noted on the motor carrier's bill of lading)<br><br>Operation number:<span class='indent-20'>&#09;</span>812355<br><br>Flat rate time:<span class='indent-20'>&#09;</span>1.0 hour<br><br>Failed P/N:<span class='indent-20'>&#09;</span>PDI-<a href="3331.html">PAINT</a><br><br>*Defect code:<span class='indent-20'>&#09;</span>08103<br><br>Symptom code<span class='indent-20'>&#09;</span>08811*<br><br>Skill level:<span class='indent-20'>&#09;</span>Repair Technician<br><br><b>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>When submitting the claim, make sure you enter the vehicle's date of receipt in the customer contention comment section. *The claim will be rejected without this information.*<br><br>REPAIR PROCEDURE<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wash and dry the vehicle out of direct sunlight.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/871727861.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tear off a piece of clay.
