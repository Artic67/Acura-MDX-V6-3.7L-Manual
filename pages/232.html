<h1>General Troubleshooting Information</h1><b>How to Troubleshoot DTCs</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>DTC troubleshooting procedures assume the cause of the problem is still present and the TPMS indicator is still on. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>(<b>NOTE: </b>The TPMS indicator comes on for DTCs 11, 13, 15, and 17 only if the low tire pressure indication is false, caused by a problem in the system.) <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Do not use a troubleshooting procedure unless the system has set the DTC listed for it.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ask the customer to describe the conditions when the indicator came on, and try to reproduce the same conditions for troubleshooting. Find out if the customer checked and/or adjusted tire pressures since the indicator came on.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If an indicator does not come on during the test-drive, check for loose terminals, poor contact due to damaged terminals, etc. before you start troubleshooting.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After troubleshooting, clear the DTCs, and test-drive the vehicle. Make sure no indicators come on.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check for other unit DTCs which are connected via F-CAN. If there are DTCs that are related to F-CAN, the most likely cause was that the ignition switch was turned ON (II) with the TPMS control unit connector disconnected. Clear the DTCs. Check for PGM-FI and TPMS codes, and troubleshoot those first.<br></div>
