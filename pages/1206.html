<h1>Procedures</h1><b>ATF Cooler Cleaning</b><br><br><b>Special Tools Required</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>ATF cooler cleaner GHTTTCF6H<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Magnetic nonbypass spin-on filter GTHGNBP2 <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>These special tools are available through the American Honda Tool and Equipment Program 1-888-424-6857.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Before installing an overhauled or remanufactured automatic transmission, you must thoroughly clean the ATF cooler to prevent system contamination. Failure to do so could cause a repeat automatic transmission failure.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The cleaning procedure involves heated ATF DW-1 (ATF Z1 has been replaced by ATF DW-1, Honda Service News Nov 2010) delivered under high pressure (<b>100 psi</b>). Check the security of all hoses and connections. Always wear safety glasses or a face shield, along with gloves and protective clothing. If you get ATF in your eyes or on your skin, rinse with water immediately.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>WARNING: <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Improper use of the ATF cooler cleaner can result in burns and other serious injuries.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always wear eye protection and protective clothing, and follow all instructions in this manual.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check the fluid in the cooler cleaner tank. (The fluid level should be <b>4.5 inches</b> from the top of the filler neck.) Adjust the level if needed; do not overfill. Use only Acura ATF DW-1 (ATF Z1 has been replaced by ATF DW-1, Honda Service News Nov 2010); do not use any additives.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/532133286.png"></div><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Plug the cooler cleaner into a <b>110 V</b> grounded electrical outlet.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>NOTICE:</b> Make sure the outlet has no other appliances (light fixtures, drop lights, extension cords) plugged into it. Also, never plug the cooler cleaner into an extension cord or drop light; you could damage the unit.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/532139866.png"></div><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Flip the HEAT toggle switch to ON; the green indicator above the toggle switch comes on.
