The current list can be found at www.acura.com/realtimetraffic. The site also contains a traffic demo and FAQs.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Traffic flow speed is displayed as bands of red, orange, and green alongside of the freeway. Some or all freeways in a covered city may not have traffic coverage. The link above shows the freeways covered for each city.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Incident icons (yellow or red diamonds) point put accidents, construction areas, or weather conditions.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Not all areas have "traffic flow" and "traffic icons."
