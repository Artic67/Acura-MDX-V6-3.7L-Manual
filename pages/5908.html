<h1>Hydraulic Flow</h1><b>Hydraulic Flow</b><br><br><b>Distribution of Hydraulic Pressure</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>As the engine turns, the ATF pump starts to operate. Automatic transmission fluid (ATF) is drawn through the ATF strainer (filter) and discharged into the hydraulic circuit. Then, ATF flowing from the ATF pump becomes line pressure that is regulated by the regulator valve. Torque converter pressure from the regulator valve enters the torque converter through the lock-up shift valve and lock-up control valve, and it is discharged from the torque converter. The torque converter check valve prevents torque converter pressure from rising.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The PCM controls shift solenoid valves A, B, C, and D ON and OFF, and the shift solenoid valves control shift solenoid pressure to the shift valves. Applying shift solenoid pressure to the shift valves moves the position of the shift valve, and switches the port of hydraulic pressure. The PCM also controls A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves A, B and C. The A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves regulate hydraulic pressure, and apply the pressure to CPC valves A and B, and reverse CPC valve.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When shifting between gears, the clutch is engaged by pressure from the CPC pressure mode. The PCM controls one of the shift solenoid valves to move the position of the shift valve. This movement switches the port of CPC pressure and line pressure. Line pressure is then applied to the clutch, and CPC pressure is released. Engaging the clutch with line pressure mode happens when shifting is completed.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/539441342.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>N Position</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Line pressure (1) regulated by the regulator valve flows to shift solenoid valves.
