<h1>Air Bag Systems: Description and Operation</h1><b>SRS System Description</b><br><br><b>SRS Components</b><br><br><b>Airbags</b><br>The SRS is a safety device which, when used with the <a href="2346.html">seat belt</a>, is designed to help protect the driver and front passenger in a frontal impact exceeding a certain set limit. The system consists of the SRS unit, including <a href="144.html">safing sensor</a> and <a href="142.html">impact sensor</a> (A), the cable reel (B), the driver's airbag (C), the front passenger's airbag (D), side airbags (E), side curtain airbags (F), <a href="2348.html">seat belt tensioners</a> (G), side impact sensors (first) (H), front impact sensors (I), <a href="143.html">roll rate sensor</a> (J), satellite safing sensor (K) and side impact sensors (second) (L).<br><br>Since the driver's and front passenger's airbags use the same sensors, both normally inflate at the same time. However, it is possible for only one airbag to inflate. This can occur when the severity of a collision is at the margin, or threshold, that the SRS unit determines whether or not the airbags will deploy. In such cases, the <a href="2346.html">seat belt</a> will provide sufficient protection, and the supplemental protection offered by the airbag would be minimal.<br><br><b>Front Passenger's Weight Sensors</b><br>The ODS unit (M) is in the front passenger's seat-back along with the weight sensors (N). The weight sensors detect the weight on the seat, and send the information to the ODS unit. If the total weight is <b>about 65 lbs (30 kg) or less</b>, the ODS unit sends a signal to the SRS unit to prevent the passenger's airbag from deploying. When the passenger's airbag is disabled, the passenger airbag cutoff indicator on the center panel comes on to alert the driver that the front passenger's airbag will not deploy in a front-end collision.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/728118595.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Driver's <a href="147.html">Seat Position Sensor</a></b><br>The driver's seat position sensor (O) is under the driver's seat on the left side. When the driver's seat is moved to its full forward position, the deployment of the driver's airbag is moderated to decrease its force of impact during a front-end collision.<br><br><b><a href="143.html">Roll Rate Sensor</a></b><br>The roll rate sensor is located under the second row seat. It detects the amount of roll of the vehicle and sends the information to the SRS unit. The SRS unit uses this information to determine if a vehicle rollover is imminent. If so, it deploys both side curtain airbags and the front <a href="2348.html">seat belt tensioners</a>.<br><br><b>Satellite <a href="144.html">Safing Sensor</a></b><br>The satellite safing sensor is located under the second row seat. The satellite safing sensor performs the same basic function as the safing sensor in the SRS unit. It measures sideways G force, such as the force the vehicle would receive in a side collision in the rear, and sends that information to the SRS unit. The SRS unit uses that information, and the information from the second side impact sensors to determine the side that is impacted and the force. If the threshold is met, the SRS unit deploys the side airbag, the side curtain airbag and the <a href="2348.html">seat belt tensioner</a> on that side.<br><br><b>Side Airbag Cutoff Indicator/ODS Operation</b><br>The indicator comes on if the front passenger's seat is occupied by a small adult or child who is leaning into the deployment path, or an object (grocery bag, briefcase, purse, etc.) is in the seat. This indicates the passenger's side airbag is off and will not deploy; there is no problem with the side airbag. If the passenger sits upright or moves to another seat, or you remove the object from the seat, the light should go off. There will be some delay between the occupant's repositioning, and when the indicator will turn on or off.<br><br><b>Passenger Airbag Cutoff Indicator</b><br>The indicator comes on if the weight of the front passenger is <b>about 65 lbs (30 kg) or less</b>. This indicates the passenger's front airbag is off and will not deploy. The front airbag is shut off to reduce the chance of airbag-caused injuries.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/728131122.png"></div><br><br><br><b>SRS Operation</b><br>The main circuit in the SRS unit senses and judges the force of impact and, if necessary, ignites the inflator charges. If battery voltage is too low or power is disconnected due to the impact, the voltage regulator and the back-up power circuit will keep voltage at a constant level.<br><br><b>For the SRS to operate<br><br><a href="2348.html">Seat Belt Tensioners</a></b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A front impact sensor, side impact sensor, or the satellite <a href="144.html">safing sensor</a> must activate and send electric signals to the microprocessor.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The microprocessor must compute the signals and send them to the tensioners.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The charges must ignite and deploy the tensioners.<br><br><b>Driver's and Front Passenger's Airbag(s)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A front impact sensor must activate, and send electric signals to the microprocessor.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The microprocessor must compute the signals, and send them to the airbag inflator(s).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The inflators that received signals must ignite and deploy the airbags.<br><br><b>Side Airbag(s)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Aside <a href="142.html">impact sensor</a> must activate, and send electric signals to the microprocessor.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The microprocessor must compute the signals and send them to the side airbag inflator(s).

The system must be inspected and repaired as soon as possible.<br><br>For better serviceability, the SRS unit memory stores a DTC that relates to the cause of the malfunction, and the unit is connected to the data link connector (DLC). This information can be read with the HDS when it is connected to the DLC (16P).<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  Before you disconnect the negative cable from the battery for troubleshooting, make sure you have the anti-theft codes for the audio system and the navigation system (if equipped).<br><br><h3>SRS Unit Inputs And Outputs At Connector A (28P):</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/728142413.png"></div><br><br><br><b>SRS Unit Inputs And Outputs At Connector A (28P)</b><br><br><h3>SRS Unit Inputs And Outputs At Connector B (28P):</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/728164373.png"></div><br><br><br><b>SRS Unit Inputs And Outputs At Connector B (28P)</b><br><br><h3>SRS Unit Inputs And Outputs At Connector C (16P):</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/728188910.png"></div><br><br><br><b>SRS Unit Inputs And Outputs At Connector c (16P)</b></div>
