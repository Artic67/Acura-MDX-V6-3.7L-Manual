<h1>Advanced Diagnostics</h1><b>DTC P0116: Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) Sensor 1 Circuit Range/Performance Problem</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/15285538.png"></div><br><br><br><b>General Description</b><br>The powertrain control module (PCM) supplies voltage to the engine coolant temperature (ECT) signal circuit (<b>about 5 V</b>) through a pull-up resistor. As the engine coolant cools, ECT sensor 1 resistance increases, and the PCM detects a high signal voltage. As the engine coolant warms, ECT sensor 1 resistance decreases, and the PCM detects a low signal voltage. If the ECT output voltage after driving a set time after starting the engine does not reach a set temperature, or when the difference between the ECT output voltage when driving and the output voltage of the ECT after the engine is stopped a set time does not change a certain amount, the PCM detects a malfunction and a DTC is stored.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/15289894.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Monitor Execution, Sequence, Duration, DTC Type, OBD Status</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/15292089.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Enable Conditions</b><br><br><b>Malfunction Threshold</b><br><b>Malfunction determination 1:</b><br>With a completely cooled engine (one that has been off for <b>at least 6 hours</b>):<br>When the change in coolant temperature <b>after 10 minutes or more</b> of running time is <b>50 &deg;F (10 &deg;C) or less</b>, a malfunction is detected.<br><br><b>Malfunction determination 2:</b><br>With a partially cooled engine (one that has been off for <b>less than 6 hours</b>):<br>When the difference between the coolant temperature <b>after 10 minutes or more</b> of running time minus the coolant temperature after the engine has been off for <b>150 minutes</b> and then run for <b>10 seconds is 50 &deg;F (10 &deg;C) or less</b>, a malfunction is detected.<br><br><b>Driving Pattern</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With a completely cooled engine (one that has been off for <b>at least 6 hours</b>).<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Start the engine, and let it idle for <b>at least 10 minutes.</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Turn off the ignition for <b>10 seconds</b>, then restart the engine and let it idle for <b>at least 10 seconds.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With a partially cooled engine (one that has been off <b>for less than 6 hours</b>).<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Start the engine, and let it idle for <b>at least 10 minutes</b>.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Turn off the ignition for <b>150 minutes</b>, then restart the engine and let it idle for <b>at least 10 seconds.</b><br><br><b>Diagnosis Details</b><br><br><b>Conditions for illuminating the MIL</b><br>When a malfunction is detected during the first drive cycle, a Temporary DTC is stored in the PCM memory.
