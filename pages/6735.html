<h1>Advanced Diagnostics</h1><b>DTC P0797: A/T Clutch Pressure Control Solenoid Valve C Stuck ON</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/32653053.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/32663104.png"></div><br><br><br><b>General Description</b><br>A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve C is installed in the transmission housing. A/T clutch pressure control solenoid A is operated by the powertrain control module (PCM) and converts the modulated pressure to A/T clutch pressure control solenoid A pressure, which operates CPC valve A. Line pressure is modulated to clutch pressure control A pressure (CPC A pressure) by CPC valve A and the CPC valve A spring. A signal from the PCM is output to the proper gear clutch, determined by the gear schedule, to supply the proper CPC pressure according to the driving conditions. When the current from the PCM is high (ON), A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve C operates and the CPC valve A pressure increases. When the current from the PCM is low (OFF), A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve C turns off and CPC valve A pressure decreases. The PCM monitors the transmission fluid pressure switch at the gear change determined by the shift schedule. When the wrong transmission fluid pressure switch is turned on, an A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve C turn-on malfunction is detected and a DTC is stored.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/32671919.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Monitor Execution, Sequence, Duration, DTC Type, OBD Status</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/32674443.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Enable Conditions</b><br><br><b>Malfunction Threshold</b><br>The 2nd clutch transmission fluid switch is ON against the 3rd -> 4th gear upshift command for <b>at least 11 seconds.</b><br><br><b>Driving Pattern</b><br>Start the engine, and accelerate the vehicle until the transmission shifts into 5th gear in the D position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle in this manner only if the traffic regulations and ambient conditions allow.<br><br><b>Diagnosis Details</b><br><br><b>Conditions for illuminating the MIL</b><br>When a malfunction is detected during the first drive cycle, a Temporary DTC is stored in the PCM memory.
