If the window still doesn't work, go to Symptom 2.<br><br>REPAIR PROCEDURE<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>You must do the manual reset from the <a href="4239.html">power window switch</a> at the affected window. For example, if you're resetting the front passenger's power window control unit, do it from the front passenger's power window switch, not the driver's power window master switch.<br><br>1.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch to ON (II).<br><br>2.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Lower the window all the way down with the <a href="4239.html">power window switch</a>.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Open the driver's or front passenger's door.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>NOTE:<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Do steps 4 thru 7 within 5 seconds of each other. Do these steps a total of four times in a row. These steps clear the control unit's memory.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0).<br><br>5.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Push down and hold the <a href="4239.html">power window switch</a>.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch to ON (II).<br><br>7.<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Release the <a href="4239.html">power window switch</a>.<br><br><b><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>:<br><span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Make sure the auto-up feature doesn't work.

If it doesn't work correctly, repeat the manual reset several times, paying close attention to the 5-second time limit. If it still doesn't work, troubleshoot the power window circuit.
