<h1>Technician Safety Information</h1><b>SRS</b><br><br><b>Precautions and Procedures</b><br><br><b>General Precautions</b><br>Please read the following precautions carefully before servicing the airbag system. Observe the instructions described in this manual, or the airbags could accidentally deploy and cause damage or injuries.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Except when doing electrical inspections, always turn the ignition switch OFF, ground the SCS line with the HDS to take the PCM out of active status, disconnect the negative cable from the battery, and wait <b>at least 3 minutes</b> before beginning work.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  The SRS memory is not erased even if the ignition switch is turned OFF or the battery cables are disconnected from the battery.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use replacement parts which are manufactured to the same standards and quality as the original parts. Do not install used SRS parts. Use only new parts when making SRS repairs.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/398887662.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Carefully inspect any SRS part before you install it. Do not install any part that shows signs of being dropped or improperly handled, such as dents, cracks or deformation.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Before removing any of the SRS parts (including the disconnection of the connectors), always disconnect the SRS connector.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use only a digital multimeter to check the system. If it is not a Honda multimeter, make sure its output is <b>10 mA (0.01 A) or less</b> when switched to the lowest value in the ohmmeter range. A tester with a higher output could cause accidental deployment and possible injury.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not put objects on the front passenger's airbag.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The original audio system has a coded theft protection circuit.
