<h1>ECM Reset</h1><b>HDS Clear Command</b><br><br>The PCM stores various specific data to correct the system even if there is no electrical power such as when the battery negative terminal or No. 8 IGP (<b>15 A</b>) fuse are disconnected. Stored data based on failed parts should be cleared by using the "CLEAR COMMAND" of the HDS, if parts are replaced.<br><br>The HDS has three kinds of clear commands to meet this purpose. They are DTC clear, PCM reset, and CKP pattern clear. DTC clear command erases all stored DTC codes, freeze data, on-board snapshot, and readiness codes. This must be done with the HDS after reproducing the DTC during troubleshooting. <br>The PCM reset command erases all stored DTC codes, freeze data, on-board snapshot, readiness codes, and all specific data to correct the system except CKP pattern. If the CKP pattern data in the PCM was cleared, you must do the CKP pattern learn procedure. The CKP pattern clear command erases only CKP pattern data. This command is for repair of a misfire or the CKP sensor.<br><br><b>Scan Tool Clear Command</b><br><br>If you are using a generic scan tool to clear commands, be aware that there is only one setting for clearing the PCM, and it clears all commands at the same time (CKP pattern learn, idle learn, readiness codes, freeze data, on-board snapshot, and DTCs). After you clear all commands, you then need to do these procedures, in this order: PCM idle learn procedure ; CKP pattern learn procedure;<br>Test-drive to set readiness codes to complete.<br><br><b>DTC Clear</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clear the DTC with the HDS while the engine is stopped.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch ON (II), and wait for <b>30 seconds</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch OFF, and disconnect the HDS from the DLC.<br><br><b>PCM Reset</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Reset the PCM with the HDS while the engine is stopped.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch ON (II), and wait for <b>30 seconds</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch OFF, and disconnect the HDS from the DLC.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do the PCM idle learn procedure.<br><br><b>Crank (CKP) Pattern Clear/Crank (CKP) Pattern Learn</b><br><br><b>Clear/Learn Procedure (with the HDS)</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/140323812.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the HDS to the data link connector (DLC) (A) located under the driver's side of the dashboard.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition switch ON (II).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the HDS communicates with the PCM and other vehicle systems.
