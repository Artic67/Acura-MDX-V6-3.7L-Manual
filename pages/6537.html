<h1>Advanced Diagnostics</h1><b>DTC P0128: Cooling System Malfunction</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/16104765.png"></div><br><br><br><b>General Description</b><br>The thermostat is closed when the engine coolant temperature is low, and it stops the circulation of engine coolant to speed engine warm up. When the engine coolant temperature increases, the thermostat opens and circulates engine coolant to control its temperature. When the engine coolant temperature decreases, the opening area of the thermostat is reduced to regulate the engine coolant temperature. If the thermostat sticks open, engine warm up is delayed, and exhaust emissions are adversely affected. The powertrain control module (PCM) measures the rise in the coolant temperature after the engine starts using engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensors 1/2, and it estimates the characteristics of the engine coolant temperature by calculations based on those two temperatures and the driving conditions. When ECT 2 immediately increases from the starting value, it is defined as the thermostat stuck open. When ECT 2 does not increase to the specified value, it is defined as a thermostat malfunction.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/16110662.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Monitor Execution, Sequence, Duration, DTC Type, OBD Status</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/16113312.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Enable Conditions</b><br><br><b>Malfunction Threshold</b><br><br><b>Malfunction determination 1:</b><br>If the difference between the current measured coolant temperature at the radiator (ECT 2) and the initial coolant temperature at the radiator (ECT 2) is <b>at least 21 &deg;F (12 &deg;C)</b> when the calculated coolant temperature at the engine (ECT 1) reaches <b>159 &deg;F (71 &deg;C)</b>, a malfunction is detected (thermostat stuck open); or if the coolant temperature at the radiator (ECT 2) only reaches <b>68 &deg;F (20 &deg;C)</b>, a malfunction is detected (thermostat malfunction).<br><br><b>Malfunction determination 2:</b><br>When the calculated engine coolant temperature (ECT 1) reaches <b>158 &deg;F (70 &deg;C) before</b> the measured engine coolant temperature (ECT 1) reaches <b>158 &deg;F (70 &deg;C)</b>, a malfunction is detected.<br><br><b>Driving Pattern</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start the engine under the conditions specified under Enable Conditions.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle at a speed <b>between 15 - 75 mph (24 - 120 km/h) for at least 10 minutes.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle in this manner only if the traffic regulations and ambient conditions allow.<br><br><b>Diagnosis Details</b><br><br><b>Conditions for illuminating the MIL</b><br>When a malfunction is detected during the first drive cycle with the ECT and IAT at engine start-up within the specified temperature range, a Temporary DTC is stored in the PCM memory. If the malfunction recurs during the next (second) drive cycle with the ECT and IAT at engine start-up within the specified temperature range, the MIL comes on and the DTC and the freeze frame data are stored.<br><br><b>Conditions for clearing the MIL</b><br>The MIL will be cleared if the malfunction does not recur during three consecutive trips in which the diagnostic runs.<br><br>The MIL, the DTC, the Temporary DTC, and the freeze frame data can be cleared by using the scan tool Clear command or by disconnecting the battery.</div>
