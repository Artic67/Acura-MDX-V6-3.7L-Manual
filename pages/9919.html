<h1>A/T - Fluid Cooler Flushing Equipment Information</h1>89-015<br><br>May 16, 2008<br><br>Applies To: <br>Vehicles With an In-Radiator ATF Cooler - ALL<br><br>ATF Cooler Cleaner<br><br>(Supersedes 89-015, dated July 9, 2004, to update the information marked by asterisks)<br><br>Before installing an overhauled or remanufactured A/T, you must thoroughly clean the ATF cooler to prevent system contamination. Failure to do so could cause a repeat A/T failure. The ATF Cooler Cleaner (P/N GTHTTCF6H) is a portable, electrically operated special tool that cleans the ATF cooler with high-pressure, heated ATF. This cleaning action melts down waxy varnish residue left by burnt ATF and purges metal particles, clutch material, and other contaminants. The ATF Cooler Cleaner has these features:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Quick-connect fittings and color-coded hoses for easy hookup.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Uses about 9.5 gallons of Acura ATF-Z1, which gets filtered and recirculated.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Heats ATF to a temperature of 140&deg; to 150&deg;F and then pumps it through the ATF cooler at high pressure (100 psi) using a pulsating action and air purging. Switching the hoses cleans the ATF cooler in the reverse direction.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Two magnetic nonbypass spin-on filters to trap purged contaminants.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Built-in tool tray.<br><br>This service bulletin gives you information for ordering and servicing this special tool, and guides you through the entire ATF cooler cleaning process.<br><br>*REQUIRED MATERIALS<br><br>Acura Precision Crafted ATF-Z1: P/N 08200-9001A<br><br>Magnetic Nonbypass Spin-On Filter:<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>T/N GTHNBP12 (12-pack)<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>T/N GTHNBP2 (6-pack)<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>T/N GTHGNBP22 (2-pack)<br><br>ORDERING INFORMATION<br><br>Additional ATF cooler cleaners or magnetic nonbypass spin-on filters can be ordered through the Acura Tool and Equipment Program. To order on the iN, click on SERVICE, then Service Bay, then Tool and Equipment Program.

Check the security of all hoses and connections. Always wear safety glasses or a face shield, gloves, and protective clothing. If you get ATF in your eyes or on your skin, rinse with water immediately.<br><br><b>!WARNING</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Improper use of the ATF cooler cleaner can result in burns and other serious injuries.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Always wear eye protection and protective clothing, and follow all instructions in this bulletin.<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Plug the ATF cooler cleaner into a 110 V grounded electrical outlet.<br><br><b>[NOTICE]</b><br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Make sure the outlet has no other appliances (light fixtures, drop lights, extension cords) plugged into it. Also, never plug the cooler cleaner into an extension cord or drop light cord; you would damage the unit.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Flip the HEAT toggle switch to ON. Wait 1 hour for the cooler cleaner to reach its operating temperature. (The cooler cleaner is ready to use when the temperature gauge reads 140&deg; to 150&deg;F.)<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the appropriate fittings to the ATF cooler inlet and outlet lines. Connect the red hose to the cooler outlet line (the line going to the external filter). Connect the blue hose to the cooler inlet line.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect a shop air hose to the air purge valve.<br><br><b><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>[NOTICE]</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The quick connect fitting has a one-way check valve to keep ATF from entering your shop's air system. Do not remove or replace the fitting. Attach the coupler provided with the cooler cleaner to your shop air line if your coupler is not compatible.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Flip the MOTOR toggle switch to ON, and let the pump run for 5 minutes. While the pump is running, open and close the air purge valve periodically to cause agitation and improve the cleaning process.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Flip the MOTOR toggle switch to OFF with the air purge valve open. Leave the air purge valve open for at least 15 seconds to purge the lines of residual ATF.<br><br>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Disconnect the red and blue hoses from the ATF cooler.
