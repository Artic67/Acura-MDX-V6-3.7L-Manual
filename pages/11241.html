<h1>A/T - Whining Noise Information</h1>Whiny A/T? Consider This Before Ordering a Reman<br><br>Got a vehicle in your shop for a whiny A/T? Before you go off and order a reman unit, you need to consider a few things first. Our reman center has found that 30 to 40 percent of the failed A/Ts returned for noise problems turned out being NTF after inspection.<br><br>To avoid unnecessary A/T replacement, here are some general front-wheel-drive facts you need to think about as you troubleshoot:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Front-wheel-drive vehicles have a transaxle instead of a conventional A/T with a rear differential. The transaxle combines A/T and differential gears, shafts, and bearings into a compact package that's mounted right next to the passenger compartment. Because the transaxle is so close to the passenger compartment, the noise from the transaxle is more evident than the noise from a conventional A/T with a rear differential.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Front-wheel-drive vehicles can transmit <a href="1357.html">wheel bearing</a>, tire, and transaxle noises into the passenger compartment more readily than vehicles with rear wheel drive. Test-drive both your client's vehicle and an identical known good vehicle for comparison. Some noises can take up to 20 miles of highway-speed driving to duplicate, so hang in there and be patient. If the noise level is the same in both vehicles, don't bother ordering a reman unit.</div>
