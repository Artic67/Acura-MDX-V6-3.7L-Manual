<h1>How to Troubleshoot DTCs</h1><b>How to Troubleshoot DTCs</b> <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The troubleshooting procedures assume that the cause of the problem is still present and the ABS, VSA indicators, and/or trailer stability assist warning are still on. Following a troubleshooting procedure for a code that has been cleared but does not reset can result in incorrect diagnosis.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Question the client about the conditions when the problem occurred, and try to reproduce the same conditions for troubleshooting. Find out when the ABS, VSA indicators, and/or trailer stability assist warning came on, such as during activation, after activation, when the vehicle was traveling at a certain speed, etc. If necessary, have the client demonstrate the concern.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the ABS, VSA indicators, or trailer stability assist warning does not come on during the test drive, but troubleshooting is done based on the DTC, check for loose connectors, poor contact of the terminals, etc. before you start troubleshooting.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After troubleshooting, or the repairs are done, clear the DTCs, and test-drive the vehicle under the same conditions that originally set the DTCs. Make sure the ABS, VSA indicators, and trailer stability assist warning do not come on.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check for DTCs from other control unit DTCs which connected via F-CAN. If there are DTCs that are related to F-CAN, the most likely cause was that the ignition switch was turned ON (II) with the VSA modulator-control unit connector disconnected. Clear the DTCs. Check for fuel and emissions, and VSA codes, first. Be sure to troubleshoot those first.<br><br><b>Intermittent Failures</b> <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The term "intermittent failure" means a system may have had a failure, but it checks OK now. If the indicator(s) of the system does not come on, check for loose connectors or poor contacts in the terminals related to the circuit that you are troubleshooting. If the indicators were on, but then went out, the original problem may have been intermittent.<br></div>
