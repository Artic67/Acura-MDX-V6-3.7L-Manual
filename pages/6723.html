<h1>Advanced Diagnostics</h1><b>DTC P0762: Shift Solenoid Valve C Stuck ON</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/31738150.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/31742855.png"></div><br><br><br><b>General Description</b><br>Shift solenoid valve C is installed in the transmission housing. It is controlled by the ON/OFF signal from the powertrain control module (PCM), to apply modulated pressure to shift valve C. The signal from the PCM is output to apply clutch pressure control pressure to the proper gear change clutch according to the gear change schedule. When the signal to shift solenoid valve C from the PCM is ON, and modulated pressure is discharged, shift valve C is inactive. When the signal to shift solenoid valve C from the PCM is OFF, and modulated pressure is applied to shift valve C, it operates against the shift valve C spring. The PCM monitors the input shaft (mainshaft) speed and the output shaft (countershaft) speed at the gear change determined by the shift schedule. When an improper gear ratio is output compared to the predetermined gear change mode, a shift solenoid valve C ON failure is detected and a DTC is stored.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/31747915.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Monitor Execution, Sequence, Duration, DTC Type, OBD Status</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/31750501.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Enable Conditions</b><br><br><b>Malfunction Threshold</b><br>The transmission is held in 3rd gear against the 3rd -> 4th gear upshift command for as long as <b>20 seconds</b>, without records that the gear change time was short when the 2nd -> 3rd gear upshift were commanded.<br><br><b>Driving Pattern</b><br>Start the engine, and accelerate the vehicle until the transmission shifts into 5th gear in the D position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle in this manner only if the traffic regulations and ambient conditions allow.<br><br><b>Diagnosis Details</b><br><br><b>Conditions for illuminating the MIL</b><br>When a malfunction is detected during the first drive cycle, a Temporary DTC is stored in the PCM memory.
