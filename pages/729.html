<h1>Monitors, Trips, Drive Cycles and Readiness Codes</h1><b>How to Set Readiness Codes</b><br><br><b>Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) Indication (In relation to Readiness Codes)</b><br><br>The vehicle has certain "readiness codes" that are part of the on-board diagnostics for the emissions systems. If the vehicle's battery has been disconnected or gone dead, if the DTCs have been cleared, or if the PCM has been reset, these readiness codes are reset to incomplete. In some states, part of the emissions testing is to make sure these codes are set to complete. If all of them are not set to complete, the vehicle may fail the emission test, or the test cannot be finished.<br><br>To check if the readiness codes are set to complete, turn the <a href="1643.html">ignition switch</a> ON (II), but do not start the engine. The <a href="668.html">MIL</a> will come on for <b>15-20 seconds</b>. If it then goes off, the readiness codes are set to complete. If it flashes five times, one or more readiness codes are not set to complete. To set readiness codes from incomplete to complete, do the procedure for the appropriate code.<br><br>To check the status of a specific DTC system, check the OBD status in the DTC MENU with the HDS. This screen displays the code, the current data list of the enable criteria, and the status of the readiness testing.<br><br><b><a href="0.html#Powertrain%20Management/Emission%20Control%20Systems/Catalytic%20Converter/">Catalytic Converter</a> Monitor and Readiness Code</b><br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not turn the <a href="1643.html">ignition switch</a> off during the procedure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>All readiness codes are cleared when the battery is disconnected, if the DTCs have been cleared, or if the PCM is reset with the HDS.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Low ambient temperatures or excessive stop-and-go traffic may increase the drive time needed to switch the readiness code from incomplete to complete.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The readiness code will not switch to complete until all the enable criteria are met.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If a fault in the secondary HO2S system caused the <a href="668.html">MIL</a> to come on, the readiness code cannot be set to complete until you correct the fault.<br><br><b>Enable Criteria</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>ECT SENSOR 1 at <b>158 &deg;F (70 &deg;C)</b> or more.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>IAT SENSOR at <b>20 &deg;F ( -7 &deg;C) or more</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle speed sensor (VSS) <b>above 25 mph (40 km/h)</b>.<br><br><b>Procedure</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the HDS to the vehicle's data link connector (DLC), and bring up the READINESS CODEs screen for Catalyst in the DTCs MENU.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start the engine.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Test-drive the vehicle under stop-and-go conditions with short periods of steady cruise.
