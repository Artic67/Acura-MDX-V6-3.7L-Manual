<h1>Five-Step Troubleshooting</h1><b>Five-Step Troubleshooting</b><br><br><b><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify The Complaint</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn on all the components in the problem circuit to check the accuracy of the customer complaint. Note the symptoms. Do not begin disassembly or testing until you have narrowed down the problem area.<br><br><b><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Analyze The Schematic</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Look up the schematic for the problem circuit. Determine how the circuit is supposed to work by tracing the current paths from the power source through the circuit components to ground (certain circuits contain a "How the Circuit Works" Diagram set). Also, trace circuits that share wiring with the problem circuit. The names of circuits that share the same fuse, ground, or switch, and so on, are referred to in each circuit schematic. Try to operate any shared circuits you didn't check in step 1. If the shared circuits work, the shared wiring is OK, and the cause must be in the wiring used only by the problem circuit. If several circuits fail at the same time, the fuse or ground is a likely cause.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Based on the symptoms and your understanding of the circuit's operation, identify one or more possible causes.<br><br><b><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Isolate The Problem By Testing The Circuit</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make circuit tests to check the diagnosis you made in step 2. Keep in mind that a logical, simple procedure is the key to efficient troubleshooting. Test for the most likely cause of failure first. Try to make tests at points that are easily accessible.<br><br><b><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fix The Problem</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Once the specific problem is identified, make the repair. Be sure to use proper tools and safe procedures.<br><br><b><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make Sure The Circuit Works</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn on all components in the repaired circuit in all modes to make sure you've fixed the entire problem. If the problem was a blown fuse, be sure to test all of the circuits on that fuse. Make sure no new problems turn up and the original problem does not recur.</div>
