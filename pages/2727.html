<h1>Part 2 of 2</h1><b>GPS Information</b><br>This screen shows the current status of GPS reception. The circular diagram shows the current location of the GPS satellites (yellow numbers) as they would appear in the sky. The outer circle represents the horizon (<b>0 degrees</b> elevation). The middle and inner circles represents <b>30 and 60 degrees</b> respectively. The very center of the diagram (<b>90 degrees</b> elevation) is directly overhead. Nearby obstructions, like tall buildings will block satellites in that direction. That is why it is necessary to be in an open area to effectively troubleshoot GPS reception issues. The satellite numbers shown on the diagram correspond to the "PRN" number in the "GPS Details" screen. There are always at least 24 "active" GPS satellites in orbit. Because satellites fail, and have to be removed from service, spares are always parked in orbit, ready to be activated. This is why the PRN (satellite ID number) can be greater than 24.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  To use this screen for troubleshooting, the vehicle should be outside away from buildings, tall trees, and high-tension wires for <b>at least 10 minutes</b> with the engine running.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/783009056.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The "Number of Satellites" box shows the number of acquired satellites (maximum of 12). It should contain four or more icons. If not troubleshoot for "GPS icon is white or not shown".<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The "Current Position" shows latitude, longitude, and elevation (in feet). If there are less than four satellites, the elevation can be grossly inaccurate.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Date/Time field shows the current date, and also GMI time.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  Pressing the "map guide" button displays the satellite number on each circle.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/783012100.png"></div><br><br><br><b>GPS Detail</b><br>By pressing and holding the MENU button for <b>10 seconds</b>, a GPS Detail screen appears. This screen displays real time incoming satellite positional data when the vehicle is outside in the open. The information shown on this screen is for factory use.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The box TS/AS and H Dop/V Dop is for factory use.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Speed and Direction information is updated in real time when driving.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Date/Time Information is the same as in Setup screen 2 "Adjust Time Zone/Clock."<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the "3D" icon is shown above the yellow dots, this implies that at least four satellites are available for map positioning, and the "GPS" indicator on the map screen will be green. See the "<a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Global%20Positioning%20System/">Global Positioning System</a>" detailed explanation in the "System Description".<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the row of data in the table below begins with a "yellow dot", the AZI and EL fields can be used to locate each satellite on the circular GPS diagram (see prior screen).<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  The data shown in the GPS Detail screen is an example only.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/783015573.png"></div><br><br><br>The table of values shown on the screen has the columns:<br><br><b>Yaw Rate</b><br>This diagnostic checks the yaw rate sensor in the control unit. This device detects when the vehicle turns, and repositions the vehicle position icon on the map screen. For more detailed information, see the yaw rate sensor theory of operation under "System Description".<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>"Sensor" indicates the voltage output from the yaw rate sensor. It should indicate <b>about 2.500 volts</b> when stopped.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>"Offset" is the reference voltage or standard within the yaw rate sensor. It also should indicate <b>about 2.500 volts</b> when stopped.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A "sensor" output voltage LOWER than the "Offset" voltage indicates that the vehicle is turning to the right.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A "sensor" output voltage HIGHER than the "Offset" voltage indicates that the vehicle is turning to the left.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The yaw rate offset, and sensor should both indicate <b>about 2.500 volts</b> when stopped. If either reads <b>zero, or 5.000 volts</b>, replace the navigation unit.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The yaw rate offset and sensor should be <b>within +/ - 0.01 V </b> of each other when stopped. The sensor value should change relative to the offset as the car is turned while driving. If not, replace the navigation unit.<br><br><b>Example: Car stopped</b><br><br><b>Normal</b><br><br>Offset <b>2.526 V</b><br>Sensor <b>2.516 - 2.536 V</b><br><br><b>Abnormal</b><br><br>Offset <b>2.526 V</b><br>Sensor <b>2.623 V</b><br><br><b>Example: Car turning</b><br><br><b>Normal</b><br><br>Offset <b>2.526V</b><br>Sensor <b>2.678 V</b> (left turn) <b>2.478 V</b> (right turn)<br><br><b>Abnormal</b><br><br>Offset <b>2.526 V</b><br>Sensor <b>2.623 V</b> (no change on turns)<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>"Sensitivity study" represents the status of the internal tuning function. At initialization, this value starts at 6 and increases to # 10 as the internal correction values become more accurate.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The settings "CCW Cal Factor," "CW Cal Factor," and "Set" are for factory use only. THIS SHOULD NEVER BE ADJUSTED.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/783023039.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For detailed analysis of the yaw rate select "tuning."<br><br><b>Yaw Rate Tuning</b><br>This diagnostic allows you to graphically display problems with the yaw rate sensor.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The "ANG-Disp" value accumulates any differences between the "offset," and "sensor" voltages (see Yaw Rate diagnostic). When the sensor is functioning normally, the random changes in these two voltages generally cancels out, so the value is 0. However if one voltage is consistently higher than the other, then the "ANG-Disp" value accumulates the constant change.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The "Reset" button temporarily clears the angular accumulation (ANG-Disp), and clears the display dots.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not touch the "CCW," "CW," or "Set" buttons. These are used for factory setup only.<br><br>Two tests are explained below. For gross problems with the sensor, the stationary test usually confirms whether the sensor is defective. For yaw rate issues related to driving, perform the road test described below.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Stationary test: If the "VP" icon spins in place and the "ANG-Disp" value slowly increases or decreases in value, the yaw rate sensor is defective. Replace the navigation control unit.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/783024601.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Road test: Drive the vehicle on a very straight road. Enter the diagnostic mode, select "Yaw rate," and touch the "Tuning" button. While driving down a straight road, the white "dots" should trace a straight line across the screen. However, if you are driving on a straight road, and you notice the dots constantly dropping down or heading up as you drive, the navigation control unit's yaw sensor is defective. You can touch "Reset" to clear "ANG-Disp," and dotted lines.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If either test above fails, please enter "Yaw rate sensor defective" for the problem description, on the "Navigation core return form."<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/783025570.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Tire Calibrate</b><br>As the vehicle moves, the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> receives speed pulses from the PCM. These pulses are converted using a conversion factor to a mph speed that moves the vehicle position (VP) on the map. The navigation system has an internal tuning function that generates and refines this factor based on actual driving. The "Study" indicates the status of the tuning. At navigation initialization, it begins at 0, and increases to 10 as the navigation system is used.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The "Auto Tuning" is factory set to "ON," and should remain on.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The "Study" indicates the tuning status.
