<h1>Outside Temperature Display: Adjustments</h1><b>Outside Air Temperature Indicator Calibration</b><br><br><b>NOTE:</b>  To test the outside air temperature sensor.<br><br><b>Description</b><br>The outside temperature sensor is located behind the center of the front bumper. The gauge control module uses measurements from this sensor to display the outside air temperature.<br><br>Because of the location of the sensor, it may be affected by heat reflection from the road, engine and radiator heat, or hot exhaust from surrounding traffic.<br><br>These conditions can heat soak the outside air temperature sensor and cause inaccurate readings.<br><br>Logic has been written into the gauge control module to help prevent abnormal of fluctuating outside air temperature indicator readings.<br><br><b>Outside Air Temperature Indicator Logic</b><br>Initial outside air temperature indication after the ignition switch is turned ON (II).<br><br>If the engine coolant temperature is <b>140&deg; F (60&deg; C) or higher</b> when the ignition switch is turned ON (II), the outside air temperature indicated the last time the key was turned off will be displayed regardless of the current temperature measured by the outside air temperature sensor.<br><br>If the engine coolant temperature is <b>139&deg; F (59&deg; C) or lower</b> when the ignition switch is turned ON (II), the current temperature measured by the outside air temperature sensor will be indicated.<br><br><b>Update to the outside air temperature indicator while driving</b><br>If the temperature measured by the outside air temperature sensor is greater than the temperature on the outside air temperature indicator, the outside temperature indicator will <b>increase by 1&deg; F (1&deg; C) per minute</b> after the vehicle speed is <b>greater than 19 mph (30 km/h) for more than 30 seconds</b>. It will continue to increase until the current outside air temperature is indicated. So, the first change to the outside air temperature indicator is <b>1 minute and 30 seconds</b> after the vehicle speed is <b>greater than 19 mph (30 km/h)</b>. If the vehicle speed <b>drops below 19 mph (30 km/h)</b>, the indicator will not update again until the vehicle speed is <b>increased to 19 mph (30 km/h) or more for more than 1  minute and 30 seconds</b> again.<br><br>If the outside air temperature is <b>less than 140&deg; F (60&deg; C)</b>, the temperature <b>increases 1&deg; F (1&deg; C) every 2 seconds</b> until the current outside air temperature.<br><br>If the outside air temperature is less than the indicated temperature, the temperature will <b>decrease 1&deg; F (1&deg; C) every 2 seconds</b> until the current outside air temperature is indicated regardless of vehicle speed.<br><br><b>Troubleshooting</b><br>If the indicator displays "---------" for <b>more than 2 seconds</b> after selecting the outside air temperature display mode, check the climate control system or multiplex integrated control system for DTCs (  <a href="9108.html">Troubleshooting - B-CAN System Diagnosis Test Mode A</a>).<br><br><b>Calibration</b><br>The outside air temperature indicator's displayed temperature can be recalibrated <b>&plusmn;5&deg; F or &plusmn;3&deg;</b> to meet the customer's expectations.<br><br>Calibrate the outside air temperature with the HDS or by custom memory setting.</div>
