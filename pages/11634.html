When software versions are listed, you need to know which version is loaded on the phone to help you troubleshoot the client's complaint.<br><br>If you cannot access the Acura web site, call the HFL call center at (888) 528-7876 for further assistance. The call center is open Monday thru Friday from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. CST; Saturday from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. CST; and Sunday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. CST.<br><br>Voice Control Tips<br><br>To give a voice command to the HFL system, press and release the HFL TALK button. Always wait for the beep, then give your command in a clear, natural voice. The HFL microphone is on the ceiling by the map lights. If the HFL system doesn't recognize your voice command, you'll hear "Pardon." If your command isn't recognized a second time, you'll hear "Please repeat." If your command isn't recognized a third time, the HFL system sends you to its Help menu.<br><br>To hear a list of available options at any time, press the HFL TALK button and say "Hands-free help."<br><br>The HFL system may have problems recognizing some voices. To improve voice recognition:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Close the windows and moonroof.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Set the fan speed to low (1 or 2) or off.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Adjust the airflow from the center vents down, so that it's not blowing against the microphone on the ceiling.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Speak in a clear and natural voice. If the system cannot recognize your command, try speaking louder, in a deeper tone.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If the background noise is too loud, you may need to speak louder.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If you speak with something in your mouth, or your voice is too high, the system may not interpret your command correctly.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Find out if the problem is with one person or with everyone who uses the system. If the system has a problem with only one person's voice, this is a system limitation.<br><br>Many issues result from the client not using the system properly. Make sure the client is using the HFL buttons and not the navigation buttons. When the HFL TALK button is pressed, the client hears one audible tone. When the HFL BACK button is pressed, the client hears two audible tones. Make sure to press the HFL BACK button to exit out of the HFL main menu after completing a call and before giving any navigation commands.<br><br>The HFL system may experience a number recognition issue, such as when a customer rattles off a set of numbers in a group unrecognized by the system. The HFL system understands phone numbers in specific blocks of 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10 numbers. For example, the system understands:<br><br>1234567890<br><br>123-456-7890<br><br>1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0<br><br>The system may become confused if numbers are stated in other blocks like these:<br><br>1234-567-890<br><br>12-34-56-78-90<br><br>12345-67890<br><br>123-4567-890<br><br>Navigating Through Menus<br><br>To skip a voice prompt, press and release the HFL TALK button while the HFL system is speaking. The system begins listening for your next voice command.<br><br>To go back a step in a voice command sequence, press and release the HFL BACK button, or press the HFL TALK button and say Go back." If you don~ say anything while the HFL system is listening for your voice command, it times out and stops voice recognition. The next time you press and release the HFL TALK button, the HFL system begins listening from the point it timed out.<br><br>If you've finished or want to stop a voice command sequence at any time, press and release the HFL BACK button, or press and release the HFL TALK button, wait for the beep, and say Cancel." The next time you press and release the HFL TALK button, the HFL system begins from its main menu, and MAIN appears on the multi-information display (MID) in the instrument panel. To avoid keeping the audio system muted, press and release the HFL BACK button when you are finished.<br><br>Pairing a Cell Phone<br><br>You must pair an approved Bluetooth-compatible phone to the HFL system before you can make and receive calls. For a current list of approved phones and specific phone pairing instructions for each phone, see Checking Cell Phone Compatibility, go to www.acura.com/handsfreelink, or call (888) 528-7876.<br><br>The following procedure works for most phones. If you cannot pair your phone to the HFL system with this procedure, refer to your phone's operating manual, visit  www.acura.com/handsfreelink, or call (888) 528-7876.<br><br><b>NOTE:<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>You cannot pair a phone while the vehicle is moving.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Your phone must be in its Discovery mode.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>A maximum of six Bluetooth-compatible phones can be paired to the system.<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With your phone on and the ignition switch in ACCESSORY (I) or ON (II), press and release the HFL TALK button. After the beep, say Phone setup." The HFL responds, Phone setup options are status, pair, edit, delete, and list."<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press and release the HFL TALK button. After the beep, say "Pair." The HFL responds, "The pairing process requires operation of your mobile phone. For safety, only perform this function while the vehicle is stopped. State a four-digit code for pairing. Note</b> this code. It will be requested by the phone."<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press and release the HFL TALK button. After the beep, say the four-digit code you want to use. For example, say 1, 2, 3, 4. "The HFL responds, 1, 2, 3, 4. Is this correct?"<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press and release the TALK button. After the beep, say Yes. "The HFL responds, HFL is now searching for a Bluetooth phone. Make sure the phone you are trying to pair is in Discovery mode."<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If these steps do not work on the phone you are pairing, refer to the phone's operating manual.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Follow the prompts on your phone to get it into its Discovery mode. The phone will search for the HFL. When it comes up, select HandsFreeLink from the list of options displayed on your phone.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When asked by the phone, enter the four-digit code from step 3 into your phone. The HFL responds, A new phone has been found. What would you like to name this phone?"<br><br>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press and release the HFL TALK button. After the beep, say the name you want to use. For example, say Toms phone. "The HFL responds, Tom's phone has been successfully paired. Returning to the main menu."<br><br>Pairing Troubleshooting<br><br>Many pairing issues are resolved by altering the clients phone settings.<br><br>Bluetooth feature settings must be turned on. Phone manufacturers set the default to disable Bluetooth features to conserve battery life. Cell phones may provide procedures to "Temporary Power On Bluetooth," or "Power On Bluetooth." Turn the Bluetooth feature on, pair the phone to the vehicle, and confirm the phone is linked. Do this by turning the phone off and back on. Make or receive a call to confirm the cell phone is successfully paired.<br><br>When the phone's Bluetooth feature is on, other hands-free accessories such as earpieces or headsets may automatically reconnect to the phone when you turn on the accessory or move it within range of the cell phone. This results in the phone not connecting to the HFL system when the client enters the vehicle. You must unlink the hands-free accessory from the phone before the HFL system can reconnect.<br><br>Some phones have an Auto Answer setting that functions with a headset. This setting must be turned off or the HFL system cannot accept any incoming calls. When this setting is on, it blocks the HFL system from answering the call, and the call goes to voice mail. This can cause the client to think that the cell phone is not paired properly.<br><br>If the HFL system has six phones paired, it will not tell you that it has reached its maximum, and will not allow you to pair a new phone. To check how many phones are paired, press and release the HFL TALK button. After the beep, say Phone setup list." The HFL system lists every assigned phone name paired with it, then finishes by saying The entire list has been read. Returning to the main menu." Count number of phones listed. If there are six, you must delete one phone before adding a new one.<br><br>Pairing Checks<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Is the cell phone compatible with the HFL?<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Is the Bluetooth feature turned on?<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Is the client using the HFL buttons, not the navigation buttons, when pairing?<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Is the cell phone battery fully charged, and is there good signal strength when pairing?<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do a soft reset on the cell phone.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the client is trying to pair a Blackberry(R) or Palm Treo(TM) device, make sure the client uses the shift key when entering the pass code. If the shift key is not pressed, the client may be entering letters. The HFL does not recognize letters.<br><br>For more information about pairing, refer to the cell phone owners manual, or go to www.acura.com/handsfreelink.<br><br>Dropped Calls<br><br>Clients may perceive dropped calls as being an HFL system fault, but most dropped calls are resultant from cell phone and cell phone carrier issues. The HFL system does not directly handle the cell phone signal. It allows the cell phone to transmit the cell phone audio over the vehicle's audio system.<br><br>Before troubleshooting for dropped calls, confirm the cell phone settings:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Disable Auto Answer. If Auto Answer is enabled, incoming calls are routed to voice mail.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Disable Always Ask/Trust, Authorize Device, or similar setting. If these settings are enabled, each time the HFL system attempts to link to the phone, the phone will ask if you want to connect. If you do not allow the connection, the HFL will not operate. The phone must be set to Never Ask, Authorize Device, etc. (based on the phone manufacturer and carrier) for permission. Refer to the cell phone owner's manual for more information.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Disable Flip Open to Answer. If this setting is enabled, the phone must remain open in the vehicle. If it is closed, the incoming calls are routed to voice mail.<br><br>Always confirm with the client if the number of dropped calls is higher while using the HFL system as opposed to using the cell phone only. Clients often confuse problems with their phone or carrier as a problem with the HFL system. The HFL system cannot control or determine:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Cellular connection quality<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Signal strength<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Cellular coverage<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Ambient weather conditions that affect cellular signals<br><br>When a client complains about dropped calls, ask questions about when or where the calls are dropped, such as:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Do you drive the same route on a regular basis?<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Does the call drop in the same location?<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Where do you keep your cell phone?<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Have you compared the number of dropped calls using the HFL versus making calls from the handset?<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Does your phone have an antenna that needs to be extended?<br><br>Many reasons for a dropped call are not related to the HFL system. Here are some causes for dropped calls:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If the quantity of dropped calls is about the same when the client uses the HFL system versus the handset, the issue is likely due to the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Cellular%20Phone/">cellular phone</a> or carrier.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If the phone is equipped with a retractable antenna it needs to be extended to maximize signal strength.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If a client also notices that the calls tend to drop in the same areas, the HFL system may be operating normally, but something about the area diminishes cellular coverage to a point where the call drops.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Hills or mountains can block or interfere with cellular signals.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>High-rise buildings, bridges, or other large structures may block or interfere with cellular signals.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Placing the cell phone in a purse, in a metal briefcase, under the seat, in the glove box, or in the trunk can all affect signal reception.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>There are coverage gaps in the cellular service. When driving, a call is typically passed from one tower to another. If the client drives through an area where there is a coverage gap between towers, the call drops.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Electrical storms, heavy rain, or overcast conditions interfere with signal strength.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The cell phone battery's state of charge can affect signal reception. A low battery may reduce the phone's ability to boost the antenna's power and function properly, especially in low signal strength areas. Some phone manufacturers trade off signal transmission and reception strength for battery life. As the battery weakens, the signal strength may also weaken. Some cell phones may operate more effectively than others in low signal strength areas, especially with a partially charged battery, and depending on whether or not the retractable antenna is fully extended (if applicable). On these models, make sure the antenna is always extended to maximize signal strength and extend battery life.<br><br>Phone Will Not Automatically Connect to the HFL<br><br>If a client complains that their cell phone is not automatically connecting to the HFL system when they enter the vehicle, do this:<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the Bluetooth feature is turned on in the cell phone.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the cell phone is properly paired to the HFL system.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do a soft reset to the cell phone.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check if the phone has an Authorized Connection or Trusted option.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check the battery and signal strength on the cell phone. Pairing a phone requires optimal signal strength and a nearly full battery.<br><br>Incoming Calls<br><br>If a client complains that they cannot receive incoming calls through the HFL system, see if the call is routing to the cell phone instead of the HFL system. An easy way to know if the call is routed to the cell phone is when the client says, I can't hear the caller, but they can hear me."<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the Bluetooth feature is turned on in the cell phone.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the cell phone is paired to the HFL system and linked.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the answer settings in the cell phone are set to multi-key or any-key answer. If the phone is set to flip-open to answer, recommend changing the setting to Any Key or leaving the phone flipped open when using the HFL system.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the Auto Answer feature is turned off in the cell phone.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do a soft reset to the phone.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the battery is fully charged and there is adequate signal strength.<br><br>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ask the client if they have set specific ring tones or ringer IDs to specific contacts. If they have, recommend returning them to a standard ring tone for all calls.<br><br>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the client is pressing the HFL TALK button and not the HFL BACK button or the navigation buttons.<br><br>Outgoing Calls<br><br>If a client says that they cannot place a call using the HFL system, ask if the call was initiated through the HFL system or the cell phone itself.<br><br>If the call is placed by the HFL system:<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the Bluetooth feature is turned on in the cell phone.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the cell phone is paired to the HFL system and linked.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the client is pressing the HFL TALK button before each command and going through the calling process correctly.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the client is pressing the HFL TALK button and not the HFL BACK button or the navigation buttons.<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check if the cell phone has an Authorized Connections or Trusted option.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do a soft reset to the cell phone. If the call is placed by the cell phone:<br><br>The call will remain on the handset until you transfer it over to the HFL system. To continue the call on the HFL system, you must use the Transfer command by pressing and releasing the HFL TALK button during an active call and saying Transfer." The client can now continue the call using the HFL system.<br><br>Glossary of Terms Auto Answer<br><br>This cell phone setting forces incoming calls to automatically be answered by the handset.
