<h1>General Troubleshooting Information</h1><b>General Troubleshooting Information</b><br><br><b>DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Codes)</b><br>The self-diagnostic function of the SRS system allows it to locate the causes of system problems and then store this information in memory. For easier troubleshooting, this data can be retrieved via a data link circuit.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When you turn the ignition switch ON (II), the SRS indicator comes on. If it goes off <b>after 6 seconds</b>, the system is normal, and is not currently detecting any abnormality.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If there is an abnormality, the system locates and defines the problem, stores this information in memory, and turns the SRS indicator on. The data remains in the memory even when the ignition switch is turned off or if the battery is disconnected.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The data is stored in memory as a diagnostic trouble code (DTC).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTCs are either latching or resetting depending on the malfunction. With resetting DTCs, the SRS indicator goes off the next time the ignition switch is turned ON and the system is normal, but the DTC is still stored. With latching DTCs, the SRS indicator does not turn OFF until the malfunction is repaired and the DTC is cleared.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When you connect the HDS to the 16P data link connector (DLC), you can retrieve a more detailed DTC in the Honda Systems "SRS" menu.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After reading and recording the DTC, proceed with the troubleshooting procedure for that code.<br><br><b>Precautions</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use only a digital multimeter to check the system. If it's not a Honda multimeter, make sure its output is <b>10 mA (0.01 A) or less</b> when switched to the smallest value in the ohmmeter range. A tester with a higher output could damage the airbag circuit or cause accidental airbag deployment and possible injury.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Whenever the ignition switch is ON (II), or has been turned OFF for <b>less than 3 minutes</b>, be careful not to bump the SRS unit; the airbags could accidentally deploy and cause damage or injuries.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Before you remove the SRS harness, disconnect the driver's airbag connector, the front passenger's airbag connector, both side airbag connectors, both side curtain airbag connectors, and both <a href="2348.html">seat belt tensioner</a> connectors.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make sure the battery is sufficiently charged. If the battery is dead or low, measuring values may not be correct.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not touch a tester probe to the terminals in the SRS unit or harness connectors, and do not connect the terminals with a jumper wire. Use only the backprobe set and the multimeter. Backprobe spring-loaded lock type connectors correctly.</div>
