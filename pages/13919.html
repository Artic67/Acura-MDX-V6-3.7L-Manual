<h1>New Model Information 1</h1><b>NOTE</b>: <br>For more information on the topics in this section, refer to the 2007 MDX Service Manual, the 2007 MDX Owner's Manual, and the technical training modules indicated below.<br><br>HDS (Honda Diagnostic System) Software Version<br><br>HDS software is 2.006.010 or later.<br><br>Horsepower<br><br>The horsepower rating (per SAE standards) for the 2007 MDX is 300 hp.<br><br>SH-AWD (Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive) System<br><br>This full-time, all-wheel-drive system automatically controls the transfer of varying amounts of engine torque to each wheel independently - according to driving conditions - helping to enhance vehicle stability. The SH-AWD torque distribution monitor on the MID has a torque indicator for each wheel. Each torque indicator is displayed as a bar graph divided into five segments. The number of segments represents the amount of torque being distributed to each wheel.<br><br>If needed, SH-AWD can increase the rear <a href="2109.html">wheels</a>' speed up to 5 percent over the front wheels. The system can also vary the torque between the left and right rear wheels from a 50/50 torque split to a 100/0 torque split.<br><br>The drain and refill timing for the rear <a>differential</a> is calculated by the <a href="0.html#Maintenance/">Maintenance</a> Minder. This maintenance is very important for the proper break-in and longevity of the differential. Always use Honda Genuine <a href="1130.html">ATF</a>-Z1 when refilling.<br><br>For more information, refer to technical training module ATC58.<br><br><b>NOTE</b>:<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>If the rear <a>differential</a> or SH-AWD is replaced, some setup of the SH-AWD is required with the HDS.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Be careful when disconnecting hoses at the rear <a>differential</a> to avoid crossing/mixing the hoses during reinstallation. This will prevent water from getting into the differential. Disconnect the front hose at the intermediate joint, and the rear hose from the grommet.<br><br>Active Damper System (Sport Models Only)<br><br>The active damper system uses electrically controlled dampers on the front and rear <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a>. The system consists of front and rear dampers containing magneto-rheological fluid, a <a href="1434.html">control unit</a>, four suspension stroke sensors, and three vertical acceleration sensors. The system also uses VSA (vehicle stability assist) sensor input. The damper fluid contains magnetic particles. Using the electro magnetic coil in each damper, the system is constantly adjusting the dampers to the best setting according to road conditions, vehicle speed, and handling input.<br><br>The active damper system is always on. The driver may select between two modes (no default mode exists). In sport mode, the active damper system delivers sportier handling. You can also select the comfort mode for a plusher ride, but the optimal handling performance of the all-wheel-drive vehicle is maintained. Either mode can be used in any operating condition. The active damper system button is located on the center console. The MID displays the selected mode for 5 seconds.<br><br><b>NOTE</b>:<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>The system does not adjust ride height.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>The dampers cannot be rebuilt.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>A damper leak will not be visible.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Be careful not to damage the electrical connections when working with the dampers. If the connector is damaged, the entire damper must be replaced.<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>If a rear damper or the active damper <a href="1434.html">control unit</a> is replaced, or a rear stroke sensor is disassembled or replaced, the rear dampers must be reinitialized (set the memorization for the rear <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> at full rebound position).<br><br>The active damper system indicator on the instrument panel comes on for a few seconds when the ignition is turned to ON (II). If the indicator remains on, the active damper system is disabled and should be checked as soon as possible. If the active damper system becomes disabled, the <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> operates in a conventional manner.<br><br>For more information, refer to technical training module 8PC58.<br><br>VSA (Vehicle Stability Assist)<br><br>A new form of VSA is standard on all models. Using SH-AWD, it combines braking and engine control for enhanced <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/">steering</a> and traction in various road conditions. It detects oversteer earlier and uses SH-AWD to reduce rear drive torque at a prescribed value to help prevent oversteer. VSA can be turned off by pressing the VSA OFF button on the left side of the dashboard for 1 second. When the system is off, the VSA activation indicator in the instrument panel stays on as a reminder. VSA turns on every time the engine is started, even if it was turned off the last time the vehicle was driven.<br><br>Trailer Stability Assist<br><br>VSA includes a new trailer stability assist feature to help reduce trailer oscillation or swaying. Trailer stability assist uses the VSA sensors to detect increasing trailer oscillation. It reduces throttle or applies the brakes in a side-to-side sequence, or all four <a href="2109.html">wheels</a> together, to dampen the oscillation as quickly as possible, and reduce the speed of the vehicle. The system is designed to give the driver an opportunity to reduce vehicle speed first. If the driver does not reduce speed or reducing speed is not enough to stabilize the vehicle, trailer stability assist will activate.<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If VSA is turned OFF, trailer stability assist is also turned OFF.<br><br>HVAC - Triple-Zone Climate Control with Humidity Control and Partial Recirculation Triple Zones<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/1179697537.png"></div><br><br><br><br>The HVAC system can control the temperature independently in three zones: driver, front passenger, and second row seats. Triple-zone control is activated when the DUAL and REAR buttons are on. The system uses only one temperature sensor, but it makes different calculations for each zone. The rear temperature can be set only using the controls on the back of the center console, but the driver can choose to synchronize the rear temperature to the front by turning the REAR button off (the words Auto Sync will display on the front control panel).<br><br>On models with the <a href="0.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a>, climate control will adjust the fan speed and vent controls automatically based on criteria like vehicle direction and angle of the sun.<br><br>Humidity Control<br><br>The new system also adds a <a href="100.html">humidity sensor</a> to help prevent window fogging. The humidity sensor measures the relative humidity inside the vehicle and calculates the dew point. The system uses ambient temperature and vehicle speed to determine <a href="4293.html">windshield</a> temperature. A comparison of windshield temperature to dew point determines the probability of windshield fogging. If windshield fogging is likely, the system can automatically select heat/defrost mode, change the fan setting, and turn the NC on or off preventing windshield fogging before it occurs.<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The <a href="100.html">humidity sensor</a> is part of the vehicle temperature sensor and is active only when AUTO mode is turned on.<br><br>Partial Recirculation<br><br>Fresh air and cooler recirculating air are mixed in the blower to reduce the temperature of the intake air. This mode reduces the compressor's workload.<br><br>Electric Tilt/Telescopic <a href="1949.html">Steering Wheel</a><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/1179699364.png"></div><br><br><br><br>The <a href="1949.html">steering wheel</a> has electric tilt and telescopic adjustment. The control button is located on the left side of the <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/Steering%20Column/">steering column</a>. Push up or down to tilt the wheel. Pull back or push forward to move the wheel closer or further away. This position is saved in the driver-position memory setting.<br><br>Power <a href="3528.html">Tailgate</a> (Entertainment Package)<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/1179704667.png"></div><br><br><br><br>The power <a href="3528.html">tailgate</a> can be opened or closed using the <a>switch</a> in the driver's door pocket or the remote transmitter. To stop the tailgate while it is opening or closing, press the tailgate switch on either the remote transmitter, the driver's door pocket, or the tailgate.
