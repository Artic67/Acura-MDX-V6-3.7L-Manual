<h1>Paint - Defect Warranty Claim Information</h1>10-001<br><br>January 20, 2010<br><br>Applies To:<br>ALL<br><br>Photos For Warranty <a href="3331.html">Paint</a> Repair Claims<br><br>BACKGROUND<br><br>American Honda, its factories, and its suppliers are constantly striving to increase the quality, durability, and reliability of Acura vehicles. In the interest of making such improvements, as of March 2009, American Honda requires that digital photographs be taken of <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defects submitted for warranty repair.<br><br>Examples of <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defects include mismatched colors, dirt in the paint, gloss issues, paint runs, "hiding" (thin paint), etc. Photos of these defects help provide valuable product information to the factory for quicker analysis and development of countermeasures.<br><br>As a result, each Acura dealer is required to:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Take digital photos of <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defects submitted for warranty consideration.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Obtain DPSM authorization prior to starting any warranty <a href="3331.html">paint</a> repair.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Store warranty <a href="3331.html">paint</a> claim photos for 12 months, in accordance with the document retention policy outlined in the current Dealer Operations Manual.<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>A warranty claim may be subject to debit if the photos submitted do not adequately show the client's <a href="3331.html">paint</a> complaint.<br><br>WARRANTY CLAIM INFORMATION<br><br>None. This service bulletin is for information only.<br><br><a href="3331.html">PAINT</a> DEFECT PHOTO GUIDELINES<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Before photographing the <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defect, wash and completely dry the vehicle. Dirt, dust, and water spots visible in the photos may cover the paint defects and make them difficult to diagnose.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>To properly document each warranty <a href="3331.html">paint</a> repair claim, four to five photos are required. These photos must be taken using a digital camera, with "macro" focusing capabilities, to provide detailed, in-focus close-ups.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>For maximum clarity, the file size for each photo must be between 500 kb and 2,000 kb (2 mb). ZIP-compressed files are not acceptable.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Cell phone photos are not acceptable because of the phone's lack of focusing capability.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Before committing to <a href="3331.html">paint</a> repair, ensure that the photos you've taken are clear and in focus, and meet the standards and required number and type of photos for warranty claim submittal.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>It's best to shoot multiples of each required shot; this gives you the widest choice of photos to choose from. To free up hard drive space after you've chosen your four or five best shots, delete the extra photos.<br><br><a href="3331.html">PAINT</a> DEFECT PREPARATION<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/871995689.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Before taking photos, outline the <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defect with a wide-tip Sharpie marker pen, a crayon, a grease pencil, masking tape, or stick-on paper notes. The marking material must contrast with the color of the paint, and should clearly identify the paint defect area.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872064315.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If the <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defect extends across body panels, run the marking material across the panels to show the location and full extent of the paint defect.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872200219.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Alternatively, if you have a computer program that allows you to draw on digital photographs, you can use that to outline the defect area(s) on your photos.<br><br>TIPS FOR TAKING HIGH-QUALITY <a href="3331.html">PAINT</a> DEFECT PHOTOS<br><br>Automotive <a href="3331.html">paint</a> has evolved into an elaborate combination of color pigments, solid metallic flakes, pearl (coated mica), and transparent toners in the clear coat that give the paint its depth, color, and gloss.<br><br>As a result, some <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defects photograph better outdoors, while others do so indoors. To help decide where to photograph the defect, first determine whether the client complaint is for a surface paint defect, or if the defect is below the paint's surface. As a general rule:<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872277153.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Surface <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defects photograph better inside a shop with artificial light, such as that produced by overhead fluorescent tubes. While viewing the vehicle through the camera's viewfinder or LCD screen, move the camera to position the fluorescent light's reflections over and around the defect carefully watching for distortions in the light that best reveal the surface defect.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Most <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defects photograph better with the flash off, the exception being dirt or fingerprints embedded in the paint, which may be highlighted by the flash's reflection. To determine which method will provide the best shots, take one shot with the flash on, and another with it off, then compare the two.<br><br><b><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>NOTE</b>: <br><span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Photographing with the flash off might extend the shutter time, and may require the camera to be stabilized by mounting it on a tripod, or by holding it against something rigid.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872386550.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span><a href="3331.html">Paint</a> defects under the clear coat surface photograph better outside in natural light, with the sun low in the sky, behind the photographer, and facing the defect. The hours between 8-11 a.m. and 2-6 p.m. usually provide the best light to photograph defects within the paint, as the sunlight at these times allows you to see through the clear coat into the paint.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872471643.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>When shooting a defect under the surface, look at it straight-on, then move to look at the defect from multiple angles, carefully watching for the best light that reveals the defect, then snap that view of the defect with your camera. If needed, you may have to reposition the vehicle in relation to its light source to clearly reveal and photograph the <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defect.<br><br>REQUIRED PHOTOS TO MEET ACURA WARRANTY <a href="3331.html">PAINT</a> CLAIM STANDARDS<br><br>To properly document each warranty <a href="3331.html">paint</a> repair claim, four to five photos must be taken, as described below:<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872570855.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Photo One: Take a readable, in-focus shot of the vehicle's barcoded VIN sticker on the driver's side doorjamb.<br><br><b>Note</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If you shoot this using your camera's flash, make sure the flash's reflection does not reduce the VIN sticker's readability.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872704504.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Photo Two: Take an orientation shot of the entire <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defect area, with the lens zoomed out wide enough to show the defect's location in relation to other body parts, such as door handles, windshield, headlights, <a href="0.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Bumper/">bumper</a>, side windows, wheel, etc.<br><br>Photos Three and Four: Take the third shot closer to the defect and from a different angle, to add more detail to the warranty repair claim. Then, if needed to further support the claim, take a fourth shot from another angle to make sure that the defect and/or its full extent are completely documented.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872786811.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Photo Five: Take the last required shot as a sharply focused macro close-up, about 4 inches (100 mm) from the defect, showing exactly what the <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defect is. For example, if the defect is a mismatch in color, take a macro close-up of the mismatched panel and the correct color body panel together in the same shot.<br><br><b>Note</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>To achieve a clear, close-up photo at this distance, you may have to manually focus the camera.<br><br>UNACCEPTABLE <a href="3331.html">PAINT</a> DEFECT PHOTO EXAMPLES<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872826889.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>This photo is unacceptable because:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>it is out-of-focus and unreadable, and<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>the file size is too small (351 kb).<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872894547.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>This photo is unacceptable because:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>it is too dark, and<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>it lacks focus, detail, and marking materials that identify the area and extent of the <a href="3331.html">paint</a> defect, as specified in this service bulletin and per warranty claim submittal standards.<br><br>CORRECTING <a href="3331.html">PAINT</a> DEFECT PHOTO USING PICTURE MANAGER<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/872962418.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Microsoft Office Picture Manager is a very useful tool to help improve the quality of <a href="3331.html">paint</a> submitted for warranty consideration.<br><br>While the Picture Manager program cannot correct blurry, out-of-focus pictures, it can adjust pictures for brightness, contrast, and color, helping to reveal details.
