<h1>Initial Inspection and Diagnostic Overview</h1><b>System Indicator</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>This system has an active damper system indicator (A).<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/680331036.png"></div><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the active damper system is working correctly, the active damper system indicator comes on after turning the ignition switch ON (II) and it goes off when the engine is started.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The indicator will stay on until the ignition switch is turned OFF, or until the problem goes away (system returns to normal) the indicator will then go off.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE: </b>The damper system mode is controlled by the active damper system switch and is indicated on the MID (multi-information display).<br><br><b>Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The memory can hold any number of DTCs. However, when the same DTC is detected more than once, the most recent DTC is written over the earlier one. Therefore, when the same problem is detected repeatedly, it is memorized as a single DTC.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The DTCs are indicated in ascending number order, not in the order they occur.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The DTCs are memorized in the EEPROM. Therefore, the memorized DTCs cannot be cancelled by disconnecting the battery. Do the specified procedures to clear the DTCs.<br><br><b>Self-diagnosis</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Self-diagnosis can be classified into two categories:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Initial diagnosis: Done right after the ignition switch is turned ON (II) and until the active damper system indicator goes off.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Regular diagnosis: Done right after the initial diagnosis until the ignition switch is turned OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the system detects a problem, it will go into fail safe mode which turns off the active damper function. When in this mode, handling characteristics are limited, and the vehicle speed should be reduced to <b>60 mph (96 km/h) or less,</b> and driven <b>no more than 200 miles (321 km).</b><br><br><b>Mode Select Switch</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The system has two damping modes. Comfort and sport mode. Modes are changed using the mode selector switch.<br><br><b>Active Damper System Damper Units</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The active damper system has four individual damper units, one on each <a href="0.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> corner. These dampers function same as conventional dampers, but they should only be replaced as a single unit when indicated by a DTC. Do not replace the dampers units as a set.<br><br><b>How to Troubleshoot DTCs</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>DTC troubleshooting procedures assume that the cause of the problem is still present and the active damper system indicator is still on. Following a troubleshooting procedure for a code that has been cleared and does not reset can result in incorrect diagnosis.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Question the client about the conditions that were present when the problem occurred, such as speed, turning, road conditions, and which mode the active damper system was selected. Try to duplicated the DTC by test-driving the vehicle under the same conditions.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check for DTCs in the PGM-FI, A/T, and VSA system related to F-CAN stored at the same time. Troubleshoot these codes first, before troubleshooting the active damper system.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After troubleshooting, or repairs are done, clear the DTCs, and test-drive the vehicle under the same conditions that originally set the DTCs. Make sure the active damper system indicator does not come on.<br><br><b>Intermittent Failures</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The term "Intermittent failure" means a system may have had a failure, but it checks OK now. If the active damper system indicator does not come on, check for poor connections or loose terminals at all connectors related to the circuit that you are troubleshooting. If the indicator was on but then went out, the original problem may have been intermittent.<br></div>
