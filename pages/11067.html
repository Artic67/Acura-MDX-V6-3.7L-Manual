<h1>Campaign - Corroded Front Strut Coil Connectors</h1>11-006<br><br>June 24, 2011<br><br>Applies To: <br>See VEHICLES AFFECTED<br><br>Product Update: Front Damper Coil Connector Corrosion/ADS Indicator Is On <br><br>(Supersedes 11-006, dated May 14, 2011, to revise the information marked by asterisks)<br><br>Product Update: Front Damper Coil Connector Corrosion/ADS Indicator Is On)<br><br>REVISION SUMMARY<br><br>*Under VEHICLES AFFECTED, some 2007 models were added.*<br><br>BACKGROUND<br><br>On some vehicles with the active damper system (ADS), the damper coil connectors on the bottom of the front dampers do not have enough corrosion protection. In areas where road salt* is used, the damper coil connectors are susceptible to corrosion. Over time, excessive corrosion may cause the damper coil connectors to fail, resulting in a loss of damper fluid metering. Corroded front damper coil connectors can also cause the ADS indicator to stay on with one or more of these DTCs:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>DTC 5-5: Active damper control unit internal right-front damper coil drive circuit stuck off<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>DTC 5-6: Active damper control unit internal left-front damper coil drive circuit stuck off<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>DTC 6-1: Active damper control unit internal right-front damper coil drive circuit current lower than expected<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>DTC 6-2: Active damper control unit internal left-front damper coil drive circuit current lower than expected<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>DTC 7-9: Active damper control unit internal circuit malfunction<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/675213016.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>**Road salt is commonly used in an area known as the salt belt." As shown in the shaded area of the map, the salt belt includes these states: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington D.C.**<br><br>VEHICLES AFFECTED<br><br>*2007 MDX w/Sport Package*<br>2008 MDX w/Sport Package<br>2009 MDX w/Sport Package<br><br>Not all vehicles with the Sport Package are affected.<br>Only those vehicles that were sold into or are currently registered in areas where road salt is used are affected by this campaign. To verify vehicle eligibility, you must check at least one of these items:<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/675297474.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The client has a notification letter.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The vehicle is shown as eligible on an iN VIN status inquiry.<br><br>If the client has a notification letter, the vehicle is eligible for the campaign even if the vehicle is currently registered or located outside of the "salt belt."<br><br>In addition, check for a punch mark above the third character of the engine compartment VIN. A punch mark in that location means the vehicle has already been repaired.<br><br>Some of the vehicles affected by this product update may be in your used vehicle inventory. These vehicles must be updated before they are sold or leased. To see if a vehicle is affected by this campaign, do an iN VIN status inquiry before selling it, leasing it, or returning it to a service client.<br><br>Should an unrepaired vehicle that was in inventory, or that came in for service after this service bulletin was issued, cause an injury or property damage because of the campaigned item, the dealership will be solely responsible to the damaged party, and will be required to defend and indemnify American Honda for any resulting claims.<br><br>CLIENT NOTIFICATION<br><br>All owners of affected vehicles will be sent a notification of this product update. An example of the client notification is at the end of this service bulletin.<br><br>CORRECTIVE ACTION<br><br>Inspect the front damper coil connectors. Depending on what you find, install two front damper coil connector kits, replace one front damper unit and install one front damper coil connector kit, or replace both front damper units.<br><br>PARTS INFORMATION<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: <br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The INSPECTION PROCEDURE determines what repairs are needed.
