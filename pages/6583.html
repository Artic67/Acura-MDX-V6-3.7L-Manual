If a misfire occurs, the crankshaft rotation speed changes rapidly.<br><br>The powertrain control module (PCM) monitors engine misfiring based on the output pulses from the crankshaft position (CKP) sensor, counts the number of misfires, and determines which cylinder is misfiring. If a misfire is detected, a DTC is stored.<br><br>There are two types of misfire detection.<br><br>Type 1 (1 drive cycle): When the number of misfires per 200 engine revolutions reaches the level that damages the three way catalyst (TWC), a DTC is stored and the MIL blinks. When the misfire ceases, the MIL remains on steady instead of blinking.<br><br>Type 2 (2 drive cycles): When the number of misfires per 1,000 engine revolutions reaches the level that affects FTP mode exhaust emissions, a DTC is stored and the MIL comes on.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/20044727.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Monitor Execution, Sequence, Duration, DTC Type, OBD Status</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/20047526.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Enable Conditions</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/20054018.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Malfunction Threshold</b><br>The number of misfires versus engine revolutions is equal to or greater than the values in the table.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/20056153.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Driving Pattern</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start the engine.

If the type 1 misfire ceases, the MIL goes off. If a type 1 misfire occurs during the next (second) drive cycle, the MIL blinks at the first misfire occurrence, and the DTC and the freeze frame data are stored. The MIL remains on steady if the type 1 misfire ceases.<br><br>Under normal driving conditions: The MIL blinks once per second if a type 1 misfire occurs a third time, and a Temporary DTC is stored. If a type 1 misfire occurs during the next (second) drive cycle, the MIL blinks during the third type 1 misfire occurrence, and the DTC and the freeze frame data are stored. If the type 1 misfire ceases, the MIL remains on steady.<br><br><b>Misfire Type 2:</b> When a type 2 misfire (emission-related but not severe enough to immediately damage the TWC) occurs within the first 1,000 engine revolutions after engine start-up, a Temporary DTC is stored. If a type 2 misfire occurs after the first 1,000 engine revolutions after engine start-up, a Temporary DTC is stored during the fourth type 2 misfire occurrence.<br><br>If a type 2 misfire occurs during the next (second) drive cycle, the MIL comes on, and the DTC and the freeze frame data are stored.<br><br><b>Conditions for clearing the MIL</b><br>The MIL will be cleared if the malfunction does not recur during three consecutive drive cycles in which the engine conditions are similar to the first time the malfunction was detected.<br><br>The MIL, the DTC, the Temporary DTC, and the freeze frame data can be cleared by using the scan tool Clear command or by disconnecting the battery.</div>
