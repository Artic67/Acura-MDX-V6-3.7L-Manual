<h1>Advanced Diagnostics</h1><b>DTC P0455: Evaporative Emission (EVAP) System Very Large Leak Detected</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/23209768.png"></div><br><br><br><b>General Description</b><br>The evaporative emission (EVAP) leak detection system uses an engine off natural vacuum (EONV) method. The EONV method detects leakage from the change in fuel tank pressure via the fuel tank pressure (FTP) sensor with the engine off.<br><br>Here is an overview of the malfunction detection for the EONV method:<br>Step 1: Judgement of detection of <b>0.09 inch</b> leak as normal operation<br>Step 2: Judgement of detection of <b>0.02 inch</b> leak as normal operation<br>Step 3: Detection of <b>0.02 inch</b> leak<br>Step 4: Detection of atmospheric pressure failure<br>Step 5: Flickering of the FTP sensor<br>[Step 1, 2 and 3 proceed simultaneously. Step 4 and 5 proceed simultaneously. ]<br><br>Step 1:<br>After the engine has stopped, the powertrain control module (PCM) monitors the variation of the FTP sensor output to detect "no 0.09 inch leak" depending on the variation of the pressure inside the fuel tank.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the variation of the pressure is less than a specified value and continues for a specified duration, it is identified as a <b>"0.09 inch</b> leak" and the diagnosis completes.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the variation of the pressure is more than a specified value before a specified duration has passed, it is defined as "no <b>0.09 inch</b> leak", the judgement of detection of a <b>0.09 inch</b> leak is completed, and it goes to <b>0.02 inch</b> leak monitor.<br><br>Step 2:<br>After the engine has stopped, the PCM monitors the variation of the FTP sensor output to detect "no <b>0.02 inch</b> leak" depending on the variation corresponding to the increasing pressure inside the fuel tank.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If "no <b>0.02 inch</b> leak" is detected, it is identified as normal; the diagnosis is complete.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the pressure inside the fuel tank does not increase a specified value or more within a specified duration, it goes to step 3.<br><br>Step 3:<br>The PCM continues to monitor the FTP sensor output to detect "no <b>0.02 inch</b> leak" depending on the variation corresponding to the decreasing pressure inside the fuel tank, until the detection completes.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If a "<b>0.02 inch</b> leak" is detected, it is identified as a malfunction; the diagnosis is complete.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If "no leakage" is detected, it is identified as normal; the diagnosis is complete.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the pressure is not atmospheric pressure or less when the detection is completed, that data is stored and the diagnosis is complete.<br><br>Step 4:<br>After the engine has stopped, the PCM monitors the variation of the FTP sensor output to detect atmospheric pressure, after keeping the canister vent opened for a specified duration to stabilize the pressure inside the fuel tank.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the pressure inside the fuel tank after a specified duration has not reached a specified value from the sensor zero point, a canister vent blockage is detected.<br><br>Step 5:<br>After the engine has stopped, the PCM monitors the variation of the FTP sensor output to detect FTP sensor electrical noise failure, after keeping the canister vent opened for a specified time to stabilize the pressure inside the fuel tank.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the deviation of pressure inside the fuel tank and an average value after a specified duration has exceeded a specified value for more than a specified duration, an FTP sensor electrical noise failure is detected.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/23216115.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Monitor Execution, Sequence, Duration, DTC Type, OBD Status</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../images/IMP01Q313/asian119/23218371.png"></div><br><br><br><b>Enable Conditions</b><br><br><b>Malfunction Threshold</b><br>The variation of pressure inside the fuel tank is <b>0.03 kPa (0.009 in.Hg, 0.24 mmHg) or more.</b><br><br><b>Confirmation Procedure with the HDS</b><br>Do the EVAP FUNCTION TEST in the INSPECTION MENU with the HDS.<br><br><b>Driving Pattern</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the vehicle has been left for an appropriate amount of time as specified, with the engine coolant temperature and intake air temperature within the specified range, start the engine.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Warm up the engine at idle until the radiator fan comes on.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle immediately at a speed <b>between 45 - 75 mph (72 - 120 km/h) for at least 20 minutes.</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After stopping the engine, turn the ignition switch off, and leave the vehicle for <b>37 minutes or more</b> (EONV executes).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the vehicle in this manner only if the traffic regulations and ambient conditions allow.<br><br><b>Diagnosis Details</b><br><br><b>Conditions for illuminating the MIL</b><br>When a malfunction is detected during the first drive cycle with the ECT and IAT at engine start-up within the specified temperature range, a Temporary DTC is stored in the PCM memory. If the malfunction recurs during the next (second) drive cycle with the ECT and IAT at engine start-up within the specified temperature range, the MIL comes on and the DTC and the freeze frame data are stored.<br><br><b>Conditions for clearing the MIL</b><br>The MIL will be cleared if the malfunction does not recur during three consecutive trips in which the diagnostic runs.<br><br>The MIL, the DTC, the Temporary DTC, and the freeze frame data can be cleared by using the scan tool Clear command or by disconnecting the battery.</div>
